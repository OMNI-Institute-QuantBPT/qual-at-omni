## Planning Your Analysis

<!-- Once pre-processed, your data is ready for analysis.  -->
Selecting the right analysis depends on:

-   How much data you have

-   Your research question(s)

-   Whether you need exploratory insights or answers to specific
    questions

-   Your integrative framework (if conducting mixed-methods)

### Understanding Your Data Before Analysis {.unnumbered}

Before starting pre-processing or analysis, it’s important to assess the
scope and quality of your data. Take time to understand:

-   How many participants are included?

-   How much text do you have (word count, number of responses)?

-   How detailed are the responses (in-depth vs. brief)?

-   How are participants grouped (by stakeholder type, session, etc.)?

-   Whose voices are most important to elevate in this analysis?

This step ensures you choose methods that fit your dataset and align
with your project goals. For example:

-   Smaller datasets (under \~2,000 words) are well-suited to word
    frequency, sentiment analysis, or basic content analysis.

-   Larger datasets (5,000+ words) can support topic modeling or
    advanced thematic analysis.

Assessing your data upfront helps set realistic expectations for
analysis and ensures your findings are grounded, transparent, and
defensible.

### Working with a Small Corpus {.unnumbered}

At Omni, qualitative research often happens in real-world settings, with
tight timelines and limited participant availability. We may aim for 10
interviews and complete 5. We may expect long, detailed conversations
and instead get brief answers. Even with these constraints, small
datasets can still provide meaningful insights, especially when there is
consistency across participant experiences.

When working with limited data:

-   Focus on what participants actually shared, rather than attempting
    to generalize.

-   Document patterns and recurring concerns, while linking them clearly
    to the project’s research questions.

-   Be transparent about the number of participants, the methods used,
    and any limitations in interpretation.

Smaller samples can still highlight critical issues—such as barriers to
access or common recommendations for program improvement—but the scope
and representativeness of these findings should be clearly communicated.

### Suggested Methods by Dataset Size and Purpose {.unnumbered}

<!-- | **Analysis** | **Typical Recommendation** | **Wiggle Room with Word Count** | **Why** | -->
<!-- |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------| -->
<!-- | **Word Frequency** | 500+ words | ✅ High | Works even on **small datasets** for exploratory insights. You can analyze **under 500 words**, but findings may feel anecdotal rather than robust. Best if presented as observations rather than firm conclusions. | -->
<!-- | **Sentiment Analysis** | 1,000+ words | ✅ Moderate | Sentiment varies widely within small datasets. Under **1,000 words**, **tone shifts** can skew results. You *can* use it in smaller datasets (500+ words), but you'll need **careful interpretation** and clear disclaimers. | -->
<!-- | **Content Analysis (Dictionary-based) or Thematic Analysis** | 1,000+ words (small dictionaries) | ✅ Moderate | Works **well with small datasets**, especially if using **focused dictionaries** with clearly defined terms. Fewer words mean fewer opportunities for themes to emerge, so **results need contextualization**. | -->
<!-- | **Topic Modeling** | 5,000+ words | ❌ Low | Topic modeling relies on **statistical probability**. Anything under **5,000 words** will **struggle to produce meaningful, stable topics**. While you *can* run a topic model on smaller datasets (e.g., 2,000 words), the **results are less trustworthy**, prone to overfitting, and often **hard to interpret**. Not recommended without strong caveats. | -->

### Grouping Voices to Guide Analysis {.unnumbered}

Before you start coding or analyzing, decide:

-   Whose voices are we centering in this analysis?

-   How will we group participant responses?

Your grouping choices influence:

-   Which perspectives are highlighted

-   How themes emerge

-   What questions you can answer

At Omni, we might group data by:

-   Participant (individual experiences)

-   Stakeholder Group (e.g., educators vs. public health professionals)

-   Discussion Section (e.g., barriers vs. recommendations)

These decisions should align with the project’s goals and be clearly
documented in reports and presentations.

## Word frequency analysis {.unnumbered}

::::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
![](images/analysis3.png)
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
Word frequency analysis is a simple and effective method that counts how
often specific words appear in your dataset. It’s often used early in
qualitative analysis to get a general sense of prominent topics, but it
can also be applied as a stand-alone method to identify frequently
mentioned issues in participant responses. Word frequency works best
when you have a reasonable amount of text to analyze. As a general best
practice, having at least 100–200 content words (excluding stop words)
allows for more reliable interpretation of patterns, though smaller
datasets can still offer preliminary insights.

To ensure accuracy, it’s important to pre-process your text. Using
lemmatized words helps avoid counting variations like “run” and
“running” separately, and removing stop words—common words such as “the”
or “and”—allows you to focus on terms that carry more meaning. In cases
where participants mention names of places or projects repeatedly,
custom stop word lists can also help refine the results.
:::
:::::

While word frequency counts themselves do not explain context or
meaning, they can help point to emerging themes by highlighting concepts
that recur across participants or within particular sections of
discussion. For example, if words like “transportation,” “access,” and
“barrier” frequently appear in responses about service challenges, they
signal a potential theme that warrants deeper exploration. Word
frequency analysis can also help guide more interpretive methods such as
thematic or content analysis, and is most useful when findings are
contextualized within the broader dataset and research goals.

```{r}
# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Word frequencies %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# Word counts
word_counts <- lemmatized_text %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

head(word_counts)

# Visualize the word counts

word_counts %>%
  top_n(5) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Most Frequent Words", x = "Word", y = "Count") +
  theme_omni()

```

## Sentiment analysis {.unnumbered}

**Sentiment analysis** is a method that measures the emotional tone of
text by categorizing words or phrases as positive, negative, or neutral.
It can be used to quickly gauge participants’ attitudes toward a topic
or to assess the overall tone of responses across interviews, focus
groups, or surveys. Sentiment analysis works best when you have larger
amounts of text—ideally, datasets with several hundred words or
more—because emotional tone can vary within short responses, making
sentiment harder to interpret in very small datasets. However, it can
still offer insights in smaller datasets when applied carefully and when
results are presented as exploratory.

Best practices for sentiment analysis include pre-processing your text
by removing stop words and standardizing language through lemmatization.
This ensures consistent scoring and avoids misclassifications due to
word variations. Sentiment analysis typically relies on pre-built
lexicons, such as Bing, AFINN, or the NRC Emotion Lexicon, which assign
emotional values to words. It’s important to note that these lexicons
were often designed for general use (such as social media text) and may
require customization to fit specific public health or social science
contexts. For example, in health-related interviews, a word like
"treatment" might appear frequently and carry different sentiment
depending on the discussion’s focus.

While sentiment analysis doesn’t capture nuance or context in the way
manual coding can, it can highlight patterns of emotional tone across
datasets or within specific discussion topics. For example, sentiment
analysis might reveal that participants express more negative sentiment
when discussing barriers to accessing services, and more positive
sentiment when discussing recommendations for future improvements. These
insights can help guide deeper qualitative coding or serve as an
additional layer of analysis to support findings. As with any automated
method, it’s important to review and interpret results in context and to
document any limitations or adaptations made to the analysis.

```{r}

library(tidytext)

# Get sentiment lexicon (if you wanted to test for positive, negative, and 8 emotions, replace "bing" with "nrc")
bing <- get_sentiments("bing")

# Join with your text
sentiment_data <- lemmatized_text %>%
  inner_join(bing, by = "word")

# Count positive vs negative
sentiment_summary <- sentiment_data %>%
  count(sentiment)

sentiment_summary

# Visualize
sentiment_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sentiment, y = n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Sentiment Analysis", x = "Sentiment", y = "Word Count") +
  scale_fill_omni_discrete() +
  theme_omni()

```

```{r}

# Filter for the "Recommendations" section
rec_data <- lemmatized_text %>%
  filter(section_label == "Recommendations")

# Join with the Bing sentiment lexicon
bing_sentiment <- get_sentiments("bing")

rec_data <- rec_data %>%
  inner_join(bing_sentiment, by = "word")

# Calculate sentiment score by line
sentiment_scores <- rec_data %>%
  count(line, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = sentiment,
    values_from = n,
    values_fill = list(n = 0)   # Fill missing sentiment types with 0
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    positive = if_else(is.na(positive), 0L, positive),
    negative = if_else(is.na(negative), 0L, negative),
    sentiment_score = positive - negative
  )

# Join sentiment scores back to the original text
rec_data_with_scores <- cleaned_text %>%
  left_join(sentiment_scores, by = "line")

```

**Tip for finding quotes by tone**

Let's say you want to pull a quote to include in a report and you know
that you want it to be a positively toned quote in a "recommendations"
section of your discussion. You can use the sentimentr package to gather
sentiments of each sentence (or segment) and sort by sentiment score to
find the quote with the most positive tone in your criteria.

See an example below:

```{r}

library(sentimentr)

text_data_wsentiment <- sentiment(text_data$text)

sentiment_summary <- text_data_wsentiment %>%
  group_by(element_id) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_sentiment = sd(sentiment, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_sentences = n()
  )

# Combine summarized sentiment scores with your original data
text_data_with_sentiment <- text_data %>%
  mutate(element_id = row_number()) %>%
  left_join(sentiment_summary, by = "element_id")

# View the combined data
text_data_with_sentiment
```

**Mixed-methods with sentiment analysis**

Because sentiment analysis gives you a numeric output as a sentiment
score, you can imagine instances where you may want to compare sentiment
scores between groups, correlate sentiment scores with other variables
in a quantitative survey, or conduct pre-post comparisons.

## Topic modeling {.unnumbered}

Topic modeling is an automated method used to identify themes or topics
across large collections of text. It uses algorithms to group together
words that frequently appear in similar contexts, helping reveal hidden
patterns or structures in qualitative data. Topic modeling is especially
useful when you have large datasets—typically a minimum of 5,000 words
or more spread across multiple documents or participant responses. The
method works best when documents are of relatively similar length, which
helps the model assign topics more evenly.

This method is **not** recommended for use on smaller corpuses and would
be considered poor practice to rely on it to generate meaningful
insights. If you don't have enough data for this analysis, consider
using the content analysis strategy to identify themes in the data.

Before running a topic model, it’s important to pre-process your text.
Best practices include stemming words to reduce variation (so that “run”
and “running” are treated as the same word) and removing stop words to
focus on meaningful content. Topic modeling doesn’t require predefined
codes or themes, making it a good exploratory tool for surfacing
unexpected topics in your data. However, it’s important to remember that
these topics are generated algorithmically—they group terms based on
statistical patterns, not human interpretation. As a result, human
review is always needed to interpret and label the topics in a way that
makes sense for your project and participants.

Topic modeling can complement manual coding by offering a high-level
view of common themes, pointing analysts toward areas that may warrant
deeper exploration. For example, a topic model might surface clusters of
words related to barriers (“transportation,” “access,” “cost”) and
another cluster about solutions (“education,” “outreach,” “support”),
giving you a starting point for thematic analysis. Commonly used R
packages for topic modeling include topicmodels, which provides
algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and tm for
pre-processing and managing textual data.

```{r}

library(tm)
library(topicmodels)

# Create Document-Term Matrix (DTM)
dtm <- stemmed_text %>%
  count(document = 1, word) %>%
  cast_dtm(document, word, n)

# Fit LDA models with 2 and 3 topics
lda_model_2 <- LDA(dtm, k = 2, control = list(seed = 1234))
lda_model_3 <- LDA(dtm, k = 3, control = list(seed = 1234))

# Compare perplexity (lower is better)
perplexity_2 <- perplexity(lda_model_2)
perplexity_3 <- perplexity(lda_model_3)

# Print perplexity values to see how many topics we should go with- in this case 2 topics perform better than 3
perplexity_2
perplexity_3

# View top terms for both models
topics_2 <- tidy(lda_model_2, matrix = "beta")
topics_3 <- tidy(lda_model_3, matrix = "beta")

# Top terms for 2-topic model
top_terms_2 <- topics_2 %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta)

# Top terms for 3-topic model
top_terms_3 <- topics_3 %>%
  group_by(topic) %>%
  top_n(10, beta) %>%
  arrange(topic, -beta)

# Display the top terms to compare interpretability
top_terms_2
top_terms_3

```

## Content analysis {.unnumbered}

Content analysis is a method used to count how often predefined
concepts, themes, or categories appear in qualitative data. It relies on
a dictionary—a list of key terms or phrases—designed to reflect your
evaluation questions or coding framework. Content analysis works well
for both small and large datasets, making it a flexible tool when you
want to systematically measure the presence of specific themes across
interviews, focus groups, or open-ended survey responses.

A key requirement for effective content analysis is a carefully designed
dictionary that accurately captures the concepts you're interested in.
This might include terms related to barriers, facilitators, or
recommendations, depending on the project’s goals. Best practice is to
validate the dictionary by reviewing examples of matched text to make
sure the terms are identifying the intended content. You may need to
refine the dictionary over time, adding synonyms or removing words that
generate false positives.

Content analysis can help answer questions like "How frequently do
participants mention prevention strategies?" or "What percentage of
responses reference funding challenges?" It is particularly useful when
you need to quantify qualitative data for reporting purposes, or when
you want to compare how frequently themes appear across different
stakeholder groups. In R, the quanteda package offers efficient tools
for dictionary-based content analysis, allowing you to apply a
dictionary and quickly summarize how often key terms or concepts appear
in the dataset.

```{r}

library(quanteda)

# Create the corpus from your text column
corp <- corpus(text_data$text)

# Create tokens from the corpus
tokens_obj <- quanteda::tokens(corp, 
                     what = "word", 
                     remove_punct = TRUE, 
                     remove_symbols = TRUE)

# Create the document-feature matrix (dfm) from tokens
dfm_obj <- dfm(tokens_obj, 
               tolower = TRUE)

# View your dfm
dfm_obj

# Define dictionary and add themes with keywords here
dict <- dictionary(list(

  prevention = c(
    "prevention", "educate", "education", "awareness", "outreach",
    "campaign", "community education", "school programs", "early intervention",
    "public awareness", "information", "training", "workshops", 
    "parent education", "youth programs", "risk reduction", "media campaigns"
  ),
  
  treatment = c(
    "treatment", "therapy", "rehab", "rehabilitation", "detox", "detoxification",
    "MAT", "medication-assisted treatment", "buprenorphine", "methadone",
    "naltrexone", "suboxone", "clinics", "recovery support", "residential programs",
    "counseling", "peer support", "case management", "behavioral therapy",
    "inpatient", "outpatient", "continuum of care", "access to care"
  ),
  
  harm_reduction = c(
    "harm reduction", "naloxone", "narcan", "needle exchange", "syringe service",
    "safe injection", "supervised consumption", "overdose prevention", 
    "fentanyl test strips", "distribution", "drug checking", "safe supply", 
    "wound care", "community outreach", "safer use education", "condom distribution",
    "reduction of risk", "public health response"
  )
))


# Apply dictionary
dfm_dict <- dfm_lookup(dfm_obj, dictionary = dict)

dfm_dict 

# Convert dictionary to dataframe to join with original data
dfm_df <- convert(dfm_dict, to = "data.frame")

# Add row ID to original text data so we can join on it
text_data2 <- text_data %>%
  mutate(doc_id = paste0("text", row_number()))

# Make sure the doc_id matches what's in the DFM
head(dfm_df$doc_id)

# Join the DFM (now a data frame) back to your text data by doc_id
text_with_counts <- text_data2 %>%
  left_join(dfm_df, by = "doc_id")

# View the combined data

```

## Thematic Analysis in Dedoose

@qualBPT help here!! Can we add anything re coding to this guide in this section, maybe Ivonne's work? What other programs should we add?

If using Dedoose to conduct thematic analysis, we recommend a
structured, reflective approach grounded in reflexive thematic analysis
(Clarke & Braun, 2006) and informed by critical realism.

Here’s how to approach it:

1.  Start with Familiarization Read through transcripts or responses in
    full before coding.

Use memos to reflect on initial impressions, patterns, and researcher
assumptions.

2.  Develop Codes Iteratively Begin with inductive coding (bottom-up),
    focusing on what participants actually say.

Avoid pre-loading the codebook unless doing deductive analysis is needed
for evaluation purposes.

Use Dedoose’s “Descriptor” fields to track context (e.g., stakeholder
group, session type) for later analysis.

3.  Apply Codes Reflexively Apply codes carefully, updating definitions
    and merging/splitting codes as needed.

Encourage coders to discuss disagreements and maintain an audit trail of
key coding decisions.

4.  Construct Themes Thoughtfully After coding, review excerpts by code
    and group them into broader themes that reflect patterns across
    participants.

Use Dedoose’s “Code Co-Occurrence” and “Code Application” tools to
explore theme structure.

5.  Acknowledge Researcher Role Reflect on how your perspective,
    language, and interpretation influence theme development.

Be cautious not to overstate findings; describe patterns and nuance
rather than asserting consensus.

6.  Document Everything Keep a record of how codes and themes evolved.

Clearly state the number of participants or excerpts that informed each
theme.

Make your interpretive lens and limitations explicit—especially when
datasets are small or uneven across groups.

> Thematic analysis in Dedoose should still reflect Omni’s commitment to
> critical realism: treat participant input as reflecting real issues
> shaped by context and perspective, and be transparent about what the
> data can—and cannot—support.

## Combining analyses {.unnumbered}

No single method can fully capture the richness and complexity of
qualitative data. At Omni, we often combine different qualitative
analysis approaches to explore various angles of our data and answer
nuanced evaluation questions. Pairing methods like word frequency,
sentiment analysis, content analysis, and thematic analysis can help
reveal both patterns and meaning, ensuring our findings are grounded in
evidence and provide actionable insights.
