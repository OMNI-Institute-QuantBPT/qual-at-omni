    "text": "Our BPT specializes in qualitative research methods; providing expertise, guidance, and support to OMNI teams; and building internal company capacity for qualitative approaches.\nBy centering participant voices, documenting our methods clearly, and maintaining a reflexive stance, this guide strengthens the credibility and usefulness of Omni’s qualitative work. It equips staff with tools and strategies that not only meet evaluation standards but also foster accountability, responsiveness, and connection to the communities we serve.\nDo not share this website outside of Omni\n\nKey Features of this Website:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nTool Flexibility: While R is our preferred tool for reproducibility and integration with quantitative methods, the guide also includes best-practice workflows for using Dedoose (for team-based coding) and AI tools like NotebookLM (for early exploratory work).\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nMethod Selection Guidance: We offer practical decision points based on dataset size, analytic goals, and project context, ensuring methods match the scope and purpose of each evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nStructured Workflows: Omni workflows help analysts navigate all stages of qualitative analysis—from clarifying analytic frameworks and coding approaches to integrating qualitative and quantitative data in mixed-methods designs.\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\nAdaptability: Whether you're working with rich interview transcripts or brief open-ended survey responses, the guide provides adaptable tools that emphasize rigor, transparency, and context.\n\n\n\n\nOmni’s approach to qualitative data collection, analysis, and reporting, is grounded in building deep understanding of evaluation questions through a community-centered approach. We emphasize participant protections, trust building, a neutral facilitation approach, and culturally responsive design to create a rich and contextualized understanding of the data. We recognize participants as the experts of their own experience, holders of important and valuable knowledge, and elucidators of rich and varied stories, experiences, and perspectives around key issues.\nWe use a strengths-based and trauma-informed approach, attuned to the culture and context of the participants, and focused on surfacing the root causes behind inequities. We are committed to using our qualitative methods to provide valuable insights that can inform decision-making processes and positively impact communities.\nOur team has extensive experience with the use of focus groups, key informant interviews, document review, and facilitated discussions. We also employ more innovative practices including photovoice and community open house events that foster community engagement and dialogue around data and key issues. We utilize a variety of analytic approaches, and include both deductive and inductive strategies. One of our most commonly utilized approaches is thematic analysis. This process involves identifying and interpreting patterns and themes within the data, allowing for a deeper understanding of core research questions. Omni primarily utilizes qualitative software for analysis, which is a qualitative analysis software program that supports the systematic analysis of textual data. As an online platform, a team of analysts can collaboratively code data and assess inter-rater reliability. We follow best practices in the field to ensure that our approaches are rigorous, transparent, and appropriate for the research questions at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion Control\n\n\n\n\nVersion\nDescription\nDate released\n\n\n\n\n-3.0\nAdd guides and resources to website\n2025-11-11\n\n\n-4.0\nAdding interactive features\n2025-08-14\n\n\n-5.0\nSecond draft for review and rebrand\n2025-08-14\n\n\n-6.0\nInitial draft for review\n2025-03-26"

    "text": "What This Guide Covers\nYou’ll find guidance on:\n\nText mining / Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n(e.g., word frequency, sentiment analysis, topic modeling)\nThematic and content analysis\n(e.g., dictionary-based coding, thematic coding frameworks)\nNarrative analysis @qualBPT do we need?\n(Optional: e.g., structural analysis, language style matching)\nVisualizing and reporting qualitative data\n(e.g., word clouds, bar charts, heatmaps, joint displays for mixed-methods)\n\nThese methods can be applied to text from: Word documents (.docx), PDFs (.pdf), Zoom transcripts (.docx or .txt), open-ended survey responses (.xlsx or .csv), and more.\nIn many applied settings, qualitative methods (and especially mixed-methods) are described in vague terms. Reports may mention “themes emerging” or “triangulating findings,” but rarely explain the actual process used to get there. This vagueness makes it hard to replicate or assess qualitative findings and limits their credibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Omni, we aim to avoid vague or ad hoc practices. We document\nclear, systematic workflows that integrate qualitative insights with\nquantitative data when appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nWhy Are Existing Descriptions of Methods So Vague?\nSeveral factors explain the common lack of clarity in methodology:\n\nDifferent disciplines (e.g., public health vs. education research) use different frameworks, leading to inconsistent approaches.\nQuantitative research has standard tools (R, SPSS, Stata), but qualitative tools (NVivo, MAXQDA, Dedoose) often rely on manual processes and don’t always integrate cleanly with quantitative workflows.\nQualitative analysis requires human interpretation and reflexivity. Documenting every step is time-consuming, and under tight timelines, many organizations skip this critical process.\nQualitative and quantitative teams often work separately, without shared standards or mixed-methods integration.\n\n[Hannah is just messing around here to see how an .mp4 reads into R and plays]\n\n  \n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Omni's Approach to Analysis\n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\nOmni’s qualitative practice is grounded in pragmatism and critical realism.\n\nPragmatism means we focus on providing useful, actionable insights for real-world decision-making. Our goal is to help clients understand participants’ experiences in ways that inform policy, programs, and practice. This reflects a pragmatic stance rooted in the work of scholars like  Morgan (2007)  and  Danermark et al. (2015) , emphasizing inquiry that is guided by consequences and utility.\nCritical realism acknowledges that while participants’ experiences reflect real phenomena (barriers, challenges, successes), they are shaped by context and perspective. Influenced by  Fletcher’s (2017)  work and work by others, this perspective guides us to acknowledge our limitations, reflect on researcher influence, and avoid overstating claims.\nOmni’s qualitative practice draws on reflexive thematic analysis  (Clarke & Braun, 2006)  and content analysis  (Hseih & Shannon, 2005) , emphasizing the researcher’s active role in interpreting data and constructing themes, in alignment with our commitment to critical realism and methodological transparency.\n\n\n\nTransparent and Systematic Workflows\nAt Omni, we use structured qualitative and mixed-methods workflows. These processes are transparent, systematic, and designed to integrate qualitative and quantitative findings when appropriate.\n\nExample Omni Workflow for Qualitative analysis:\n\nClarify Purpose and Analytic Framework\n\n\nDefine the evaluation questions and purpose of the qualitative analysis\nSelect an analytic method\n\n\nPrepare and Familiarize with the Data\n\n\nClean transcripts/text\nRead through interviews, discussions, or sessions at least once (text like reports you may not need context for, use your discretion)\n\n\nSystematic Coding of the Data\n\n\nDeductive, Inductive, or hybrid\nDeductive coding uses predefined codes (like our dictionaries) to apply to our data\nInductive coding uses text mining or topic modeling to identify emergent themes\n\n\nTheme Development and Refinement\n\n\nAnalyze and refine codes/themes\n\n\nInterpretation and Synthesis\n\n\nCompare themes to evaluation questions and contextual frameworks\n\n\nExplore themes visually\nGet ready for reporting"

Selecting the right method depends on:\n\nHow much data you have\nYour research question(s)\nWhether you need exploratory insights or answers to specific questions\nYour integrative framework (if conducting mixed-methods)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Your Data Before Analysis\nBefore starting pre-processing or analysis, it’s important to assess the scope and quality of your data. Take time to understand:\n\nHow many participants are included?\nHow much text do you have (word count, number of responses)?\nHow detailed are the responses (in-depth vs. brief)?\nHow are participants grouped (by stakeholder type, session, etc.)?\nWhose voices are most important to elevate in this analysis?\n\nThis step ensures you choose methods that fit your dataset and align with your project goals. For example:\n\nSmaller datasets (under ~2,000 words) are well-suited to word frequency, sentiment analysis, or basic content analysis.\nLarger datasets (5,000+ words) can support topic modeling or advanced thematic analysis.\n\nAssessing your data upfront helps set realistic expectations for analysis and ensures your findings are grounded, transparent, and defensible.\n\n\nWorking with a Small Corpus\nAt Omni, qualitative research often happens in real-world settings, with tight timelines and limited participant availability. We may aim for 10 interviews and complete 5. We may expect long, detailed conversations and instead get brief answers. Even with these constraints, small datasets can still provide meaningful insights, especially when there is consistency across participant experiences.\nWhen working with limited data:\n\nFocus on what participants actually shared, rather than attempting to generalize.\nDocument patterns and recurring concerns, while linking them clearly to the project’s research questions.\nBe transparent about the number of participants, the methods used, and any limitations in interpretation.\n\nSmaller samples can still highlight critical issues—such as barriers to access or common recommendations for program improvement—but the scope and representativeness of these findings should be clearly communicated.\n\n\nSuggested Methods by Dataset Size and Purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are working with open-ended\nresponses from a survey and have data from 30 or fewer\nparticipants, carefully consider whether the data are\nsufficient for meaningful analysis. In many cases, it is appropriate to\nreport that there were too few responses to analyze\nsystematically. However, if you need to report findings, be\ntransparent about limitations. Focus on describing frequently\nmentioned key words, rather than inferring broader themes.\nAvoid suggesting consensus when data are limited, and clearly state that\nfindings reflect input from a small number of\nparticipants. Transparent reporting maintains the credibility\nof your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrouping Voices to Guide Analysis\nBefore you start coding or analyzing, decide:\n\nWhose voices are we centering in this analysis?\nHow will we group participant responses?\n\nYour grouping choices influence:\n\nWhich perspectives are highlighted\nHow themes emerge\nWhat questions you can answer\n\nAt Omni, we might group data by:\n\nParticipant (individual experiences)\nStakeholder Group (e.g., educators vs. public health professionals)\nDiscussion Section (e.g., barriers vs. recommendations)\n\nThese decisions should align with the project’s goals and be clearly documented in reports and presentations.\n\n\nReady for Pre-processing?\nOnce you understand your data, you’re ready to start pre-processing!\n\n\n  \n    Cleaning and Pre-Processing Your Data"

    "text": "Tokenization\nTokenization breaks text into individual pieces—usually words, but sometimes phrases or sentences.\n\nMost text mining techniques require tokenized text.\nThis is common for word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\nAfter tokenization, we lose the flow of sentences which is generally okay for some analyses, but not for narrative analysis or content analysis.\n\nWhat are Stop Words?\nStop words are common words like “the”, “and”, “but” that don’t add much meaning on their own. Because we want to focus on broader themes from our participants’ voices, we usually want to remove stop words after text is tokenized. This process allows us to focus on content-rich words, like nouns and verbs. We should remove stop words when running a word frequency analysis, topic modeling, or sentiment analysis.\nWe can also create custom stop words that we want to remove from our analyses, for example, location names or project-specific words that appear frequently but aren’t relevant to the analysis.\nExample:\n\nIn the example below, my custom stop words are “travis” and “county”, and they’re added to the stop_words bank which includes other words like “but”, “is”, “the”, etc. If you’d like to see all of the stop words, see View(stop_words)."

    "text": "Word frequency analysis\n\n\n\n\nWord frequency analysis is a simple and effective method that counts how often specific words appear in your dataset. It’s often used early in qualitative analysis to get a general sense of prominent topics, but it can also be applied as a stand-alone method to identify frequently mentioned issues in participant responses. Word frequency works best when you have a reasonable amount of text to analyze. As a general best practice, having at least 100–200 content words (excluding stop words) allows for more reliable interpretation of patterns, though smaller datasets can still offer preliminary insights.\nTo ensure accuracy, it’s important to pre-process your text. Using lemmatized words helps avoid counting variations like “run” and “running” separately, and removing stop words—common words such as “the” or “and”—allows you to focus on terms that carry more meaning. In cases where participants mention names of places or projects repeatedly, custom stop word lists can also help refine the results.\n\n\nWhile word frequency counts themselves do not explain context or meaning, they can help point to emerging themes by highlighting concepts that recur across participants or within particular sections of discussion. For example, if words like “transportation,” “access,” and “barrier” frequently appear in responses about service challenges, they signal a potential theme that warrants deeper exploration. Word frequency analysis can also help guide more interpretive methods such as thematic or content analysis, and is most useful when findings are contextualized within the broader dataset and research goals.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  word             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 time             4\n2 people           3\n3 access           2\n4 application      2\n5 applications     2\n6 process          2"

    "text": "Sentiment analysis\nSentiment analysis is a method that measures the emotional tone of text by categorizing words or phrases as positive, negative, or neutral. It can be used to quickly gauge participants’ attitudes toward a topic or to assess the overall tone of responses across interviews, focus groups, or surveys. Sentiment analysis works best when you have larger amounts of text—ideally, datasets with several hundred words or more—because emotional tone can vary within short responses, making sentiment harder to interpret in very small datasets. However, it can still offer insights in smaller datasets when applied carefully and when results are presented as exploratory.\nBest practices for sentiment analysis include pre-processing your text by removing stop words and standardizing language through lemmatization. This ensures consistent scoring and avoids misclassifications due to word variations. Sentiment analysis typically relies on pre-built lexicons, such as Bing, AFINN, or the NRC Emotion Lexicon, which assign emotional values to words. It’s important to note that these lexicons were often designed for general use (such as social media text) and may require customization to fit specific public health or social science contexts. For example, in health-related interviews, a word like “treatment” might appear frequently and carry different sentiment depending on the discussion’s focus.\nWhile sentiment analysis doesn’t capture nuance or context in the way manual coding can, it can highlight patterns of emotional tone across datasets or within specific discussion topics. For example, sentiment analysis might reveal that participants express more negative sentiment when discussing barriers to accessing services, and more positive sentiment when discussing recommendations for future improvements. These insights can help guide deeper qualitative coding or serve as an additional layer of analysis to support findings. As with any automated method, it’s important to review and interpret results in context and to document any limitations or adaptations made to the analysis.\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sentiment     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 negative      5\n2 positive      3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip for finding quotes by tone\nLet’s say you want to pull a quote to include in a report and you know that you want it to be a positively toned quote in a “recommendations” section of your discussion.

    "text": "Topic modeling\nTopic modeling is an automated method used to identify themes or topics across large collections of text. It uses algorithms to group together words that frequently appear in similar contexts, helping reveal hidden patterns or structures in qualitative data. Topic modeling is especially useful when you have large datasets—typically a minimum of 5,000 words or more spread across multiple documents or participant responses. The method works best when documents are of relatively similar length, which helps the model assign topics more evenly.\nThis method is not recommended for use on smaller corpuses and would be considered poor practice to rely on it to generate meaningful insights. If you don’t have enough data for this analysis, consider using the content analysis strategy to identify themes in the data.\nBefore running a topic model, it’s important to pre-process your text. Best practices include stemming words to reduce variation (so that “run” and “running” are treated as the same word) and removing stop words to focus on meaningful content. Topic modeling doesn’t require predefined codes or themes, making it a good exploratory tool for surfacing unexpected topics in your data. However, it’s important to remember that these topics are generated algorithmically—they group terms based on statistical patterns, not human interpretation. As a result, human review is always needed to interpret and label the topics in a way that makes sense for your project and participants.\nTopic modeling can complement manual coding by offering a high-level view of common themes, pointing analysts toward areas that may warrant deeper exploration. For example, a topic model might surface clusters of words related to barriers (“transportation,” “access,” “cost”) and another cluster about solutions (“education,” “outreach,” “support”), giving you a starting point for thematic analysis. Commonly used R packages for topic modeling include topicmodels, which provides algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and tm for pre-processing and managing textual data.\n\n\n[1] 46.1033\n\n\n[1] 46.13593\n\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n# Groups:   topic [2]\n   topic term             beta\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 time           0.0617\n 2     1 transportation 0.0544\n 3     1 services       0.0467\n 4     1 residents      0.0313\n 5     1 challenges     0.0297\n 6     1 agree          0.0281\n 7     1 lot            0.0278\n 8     1 access         0.0276\n 9     1 applications   0.0275\n10     1 application    0.0274\n11     2 people         0.0800\n12     2 time           0.0695\n13     2 process        0.0485\n14     2 application    0.0381\n15     2 applications   0.0381\n16     2 access         0.0380\n17     2 timeconsuming  0.0264\n18     2 campaigns      0.0260\n19     2 buses          0.0254\n20     2 simplifying    0.0253\n\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 3\n# Groups:   topic [3]\n   topic term             beta\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 time           0.0778\n 2     1 transportation 0.0543\n 3     1 services       0.0542\n 4     1 lot            0.0390\n 5     1 residents      0.0353\n 6     1 applications   0.0347\n 7     1 access         0.0312\n 8     1 vouchers       0.0261\n 9     1 makes          0.0256\n10     1 planning       0.0249\n# ℹ 20 more rows"

    "text": "Content analysis\nContent analysis is a method used to count how often predefined concepts, themes, or categories appear in qualitative data. It relies on a dictionary—a list of key terms or phrases—designed to reflect your evaluation questions or coding framework. Content analysis works well for both small and large datasets, making it a flexible tool when you want to systematically measure the presence of specific themes across interviews, focus groups, or open-ended survey responses.\nA key requirement for effective content analysis is a carefully designed dictionary that accurately captures the concepts you’re interested in. This might include terms related to barriers, facilitators, or recommendations, depending on the project’s goals. Best practice is to validate the dictionary by reviewing examples of matched text to make sure the terms are identifying the intended content. You may need to refine the dictionary over time, adding synonyms or removing words that generate false positives.\nContent analysis can help answer questions like “How frequently do participants mention prevention strategies?” or “What percentage of responses reference funding challenges?” It is particularly useful when you need to quantify qualitative data for reporting purposes, or when you want to compare how frequently themes appear across different stakeholder groups. In R, the quanteda package offers efficient tools for dictionary-based content analysis, allowing you to apply a dictionary and quickly summarize how often key terms or concepts appear in the dataset.\n\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 7 documents, 109 features (81.26% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    sure i think one of the biggest challenges is transportation\n  text1    1 1     1   1  5   2       1          1  1              1\n  text2    0 1     0   0  0   0       0          0  0              0\n  text3    0 0     0   0  1   0       0          0  0              0\n  text4    0 0     0   0  0   4       0          0  1              0\n  text5    0 0     0   0  0   0       0          0  0              0\n  text6    0 0     0   0  0   1       0          0  0              0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 1 more document, reached max_nfeat ... 99 more features ]\n\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 7 documents, 3 features (85.71% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    prevention treatment harm_reduction\n  text1          0         1              0\n  text2          0         0              0\n  text3          1         0              0\n  text4          0         0              0\n  text5          2         0              0\n  text6          0         0              0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 1 more document ]\n\n\n[1] \"text1\" \"text2\" \"text3\" \"text4\" \"text5\" \"text6\"\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n   line speaker     participant_id question section section_label  text  session\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1     2 participant P1                    0       1 Introduction   sure… Educat…\n2     3 participant P2                    0       1 Introduction   i ag… Educat…\n3     5 participant P1                    0       2 Barriers       trav… Educat…\n4     6 participant P2                    0       2 Barriers       also… Public…\n5     8 participant P1                    0       3 Recommendatio… more… Public…\n6     9 participant P2                    0       3 Recommendatio… simp… Public…\n# ℹ 4 more variables: doc_id &lt;chr&gt;, prevention &lt;dbl&gt;, treatment &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   harm_reduction &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "Introduction\nDo not share this guide outside of OMNI\nData cleaning is often one of the first things you will do when you start working with qualitative data at OMNI. Whether we’re working with interview transcripts, focus group discussions, or open-ended survey responses, the raw data we receive is rarely ready for immediate analysis. Cleaning is not just about tidying up; it’s about making informed decisions that clarify the meaning and integrity of the data while preparing it for systematic analysis.\nThe decisions we make during the cleaning process are every bit as complex and impactful as those made during coding and analysis. Thoughtful data cleaning can preserve the richness of qualitative data, while careless decisions can distort or diminish participants’ voices. Therefore, it is especially important to have a strong set of working principles to guide your decisions when cleaning qualitative data.\nThis guide covers a general approach to qualitative data cleaning, with an emphasis on useful R packages and functions designed to conquer some common challenges. While this guide includes tools and code to make your life easier, it also offers guidelines for making judgment calls about what to remove, retain, or clarify in the data.\nThe steps in a qualitative data cleaning process will always be informed by two key factors:\n\nThe state of the data when we (OMNI) receive it\n\n\nFor example, some transcripts may come from automated services (like Zoom or Otter.ai) and contain timestamps, speaker labels, or filler words that require removal. Others may be professionally transcribed and need minimal cleaning.\n\n\nThe specific needs of the project Because of this variability, we encourage a flexible, judgment-driven approach to data cleaning. The steps described in this guide are common to many projects, but their order and application should be tailored to the needs of the dataset and the analytic goals of the project. Importantly, depending on the type of analysis, different cleaning steps may be required. Consult the analysis plan and research questions in your project materials to verify the needs of the project.\n\n\nSupporting resources"

    "section": "Rationale",
    "text": "Rationale\nWhen we clean qualitative data, we apply a series of thoughtful transformations that make the data clearer, more consistent, and usable for analysis. Qualitative data cleaning requires attention to detail and sensitivity to the context in which the data were collected. The procedures we use need to be flexible because the downstream purposes of the data can vary from project to project—whether for thematic coding, content analysis, or mixed-methods integration.\nThe qualitative data cleaner often has to make many judgment calls during this process. These decisions are guided by the project’s goals, the nature of the source data, team experience, and guidance documents (like this one). Every decision and its rationale should be clearly documented in the data cleaning script or data log (more on that below). Transparency in this process ensures that the cleaned dataset remains trustworthy and aligned with our ethical standards for qualitative research.\nQualitative data cleaning requires a lot of careful thought and attention. The R code that cleans text data needs to be clearly written and well-commented, not only for reproducibility but to ensure that meaning is preserved, and participant voices are not inadvertently altered or diminished. In qualitative work, the cleaning process can directly impact the integrity of the analysis.\nJust as with quantitative analysis, qualitative data-cleaning decisions are made with greater ease and clarity when there is a clear work plan, guided by the project’s research questions or evaluation goals. Having a shared understanding of what the team hopes to explore in the data helps inform:\nWhat should be cleaned What should be preserved (even if messy) What should be flagged for discussion Two especially helpful documents to have before qualitative data cleaning begins are:\nA codebook (or at least a data dictionary) This helps ensure consistency in how we treat things like speaker names, special terminology, or sensitive content. A data analysis plan This outlines the team’s approach to coding and analysis and helps identify if additional cleaning steps are necessary. For example: anonymizing sensitive details or removing artifacts from automated transcription tools (timestamps, filler words, etc.). Whenever possible, we expect teams to develop a data analysis plan and request any available data dictionaries or codebooks from the client or partner organizations who collected the data. However, you may need to create a codebook if one doesn’t exist—feel free to reach out to the QualBPT (or whichever team you want to point folks to) if you need support.\nIn many cases, the people drafting the analysis plan are different from those cleaning the qualitative data, so strong cross-team communication is essential. We recommend including the qualitative data cleaner (or cleaning team) in project discussions as early as possible. When drafting the analysis plan, think through what text cleaning steps will be necessary to make the data usable for coding, protect participant confidentiality, and meet the project’s goals.\nFinally, whether you’re writing code for qualitative data cleaning or any other purpose, always write your R scripts as if they will later be:\n\nHeavily scrutinized\nHeld up as example code\nModified by someone brand new to both R and the project\n\nMake it easy on future OMNI-ites—and on your future self!"

    "text": "When are data clean?\n✅ What Does It Mean to Have “Clean” Qualitative Data? For there to be project tasks that direct OMNI-ites to ‘clean qualitative data,’ and a guide to help in doing so, there should also be a shared understanding of what it means for qualitative data to be clean.\n📝 Definition of Clean Qualitative Data: At OMNI, qualitative data are considered clean when they are organized, de-identified, and ready for analysis or coding.\nThat means the data:\nAccurately reflect the original source material (e.g., interviews, focus groups, or open-text survey responses) Have been transformed into a structure that makes them easy to navigate and analyze Protect the privacy and confidentiality of participants Are consistent, clear, and free of irrelevant clutter (like transcription artifacts) 🎯 What Makes a Qualitative Dataset “Analysis-Ready”? For qualitative text data to be ready for analysis, they should meet the following criteria:\nSpeaker Information Is Clear and Consistent\nParticipant speakers and interviewers are clearly labeled in the data. Each speaker’s text is grouped logically into segments, preserving conversational flow. Participant Identifiers Are Specified and Protected\nReal names, locations, and other direct identifiers have been removed or replaced with participant IDs or pseudonyms. Confidential information (e.g., agency names, job titles, organizations) is anonymized where necessary, following OMNI’s confidentiality guidelines. Questions Are Clearly Distinguished From Responses\nInterviewer questions (or prompts) are labeled or separated from participant responses, as appropriate. This can be done by adding question text as its own field in the dataset or by adding markers in the transcript. Text Segments Are Ordered and Organized\nThe transcript text is ordered according to the flow of conversation. Segments are correctly time-sequenced (even if timestamps themselves are removed). Text Is Structured Into a Tidy, Rectangular Format\nEach row represents a single speaker turn or unit of analysis (e.g., a complete response to a question). Data are stored in a rectangular table (data frame), with columns for: Session name or group (e.g., “Educators” or “Public Health”) Participant ID or role (e.g., “Participant 1,” “Facilitator”) Text segment (the response or comment) Any relevant metadata (e.g., discussion section, date) Timestamps and Transcription Artifacts Are Removed\nAll timestamps (e.g., [00:05:23], (0:12:45)) are deleted unless specifically required for analysis. Automated transcription quirks (e.g., repeated words, filler words, auto-captions like “[inaudible]”) are reviewed, cleaned, or flagged. Text Is Consistent in Style and Format\nAll text is converted to lowercase, unless case is important for analysis. Spelling errors are corrected when they obscure meaning (but regional spellings or participant quirks may be preserved if relevant). Punctuation and spacing are standardized (no excessive whitespace, missing periods, etc.). Relevant Identifiers Are Added to the Dataset\nIf there are multiple sessions or groups, these are labeled (e.g., “Educators,” “Public Health”). If there are themes or discussion sections (e.g., “Challenges,” “Recommendations”), these are identified. If codes are pre-assigned for analytic purposes (e.g., “Pre-implementation,” “Post-implementation”), they are included in the data structure. 💡 How Do We Know When Qualitative Data Are Clean? Here are some guiding questions to help determine when qualitative data are ready for analysis (i.e., clean):\nWhat is the plan for coding or analyzing this data?\nThe analysis plan (or coding framework) should inform cleaning decisions. For example, if the team plans to do thematic coding, they’ll need text organized into meaningful speaker turns or responses. What needs to be anonymized?\nIdentify any sensitive information that must be redacted or replaced to maintain confidentiality and ensure participant privacy. Are speaker turns properly attributed and easy to follow?\nEach speaker’s contributions should be clearly labeled, consistently formatted, and grouped logically. Are responses to specific questions clearly identifiable?\nIf interviews or focus groups follow a semi-structured guide, it’s important to separate questions from responses for clarity in analysis. Is the structure of the data appropriate for the analytic tool?\nIf the data are being uploaded to Dedoose, NVivo, or another platform, they should follow the required format (e.g., tidy data frame with speaker IDs and group names). Have all unnecessary artifacts been removed?\nTime stamps, filler words, and transcription errors that don’t add value to the analysis should be removed. Has the cleaned data been reviewed by someone else (QA check)?\nWhenever possible, have another OMNI-ite review the cleaned data for accuracy and completeness. ✨ Common Issues to Discuss Early in the Cleaning Process Just like in quantitative data cleaning, clarifying expectations at the start of a project will save time later. For qualitative projects, consider these:\nWill we analyze both facilitator questions and participant responses, or just participant responses? How will we handle overlapping speech, interruptions, or incomplete thoughts? Do we need to standardize participant roles (e.g., “Public Health Official” vs. “PH Staff”) for consistency? Are we preparing data for manual coding or automated text analysis? Do we need to translate or transcribe non-English responses? Do we need to connect text segments with broader context, such as the discussion theme or section of the focus group? 🚀 In the Following Sections… We’ll see how these fundamentals—like tidy qualitative data, pipes, and regular expressions—play out in real-world cleaning tasks, such as:\nRemoving timestamps and filler words Labeling speakers and organizing segments Anonymizing sensitive information Structuring text for analysis software (Dedoose, NVivo, etc.) ✅ Quick Summary of “Clean Qualitative Data” at OMNI: Clean qualitative data are:\nAnonymized Clearly structured and labeled Organized for easy analysis Free of unnecessary artifacts Ready for use in coding and interpretation"

    "text": "How do I report the results of data cleaning?\n📝 How to Report the Results of Qualitative Data Cleaning at OMNI Cleaning qualitative data is an interpretive and decision-heavy process, and those decisions need to be transparent. Reporting your cleaning process helps:\nProject leads understand what’s been done and why. Provide documentation in case changes need to be made later. Build trust in the integrity of the cleaned dataset. Support future qualitative coding, interpretation, and reporting. Qualitative data cleaning produces results—changes to the text or data structure—that should be documented in a clear, shareable data cleaning report.\n📋 What to Include in a Qualitative Data Cleaning Report 1. Summary of the Dataset You Cleaned Start with an overview:\nHow many transcripts or files were cleaned? How many sessions (e.g., focus groups, interviews) are included? What types of participants are represented (e.g., educators, public health professionals)? Example: This dataset includes transcripts from 8 focus groups, with 42 participants. Participants represent two stakeholder groups: Educators (n = 20) and Public Health Professionals (n = 22).\n\nAnonymization and De-Identification Steps Document what you removed or replaced to protect confidentiality.\n\nWere participant names replaced with IDs (e.g., Participant 01)? Were organizations, locations, or personal identifiers removed or redacted? Were job titles generalized (e.g., “CEO” changed to “senior leader”)? Example: Replaced all participant names with Participant IDs (e.g., P01). Removed specific references to organizations and locations (e.g., “at Boulder Community Hospital” becomes “at [hospital]”). Redacted job titles for anonymity when mentioned alongside unique organizations.\n\nSpeaker Labeling and Text Structuring Describe how speakers were labeled and how the transcript was organized.\n\nWere speakers consistently labeled as “Participant” and “Facilitator”? Was each speaker turn separated into its own row or segment? Were questions separated from responses? Example: Speaker turns were labeled consistently as either Facilitator or Participant. Each speaker turn is stored as one row in the cleaned dataset, with associated metadata (Session name, Speaker role, Discussion section).\n\nArtifacts Removed (Timestamps, Filler Words, etc.) Note what transcription artifacts were removed or edited:\n\nWere timestamps deleted? Were filler words (e.g., “um,” “uh”) removed? If so, specify whether this was systematic or case-by-case. Were transcription errors corrected? Example: Removed all timestamps in the format [hh:mm:ss]. Deleted common filler words (“um,” “uh”) unless they contributed to participant meaning or tone. Reviewed and corrected auto-transcription errors (e.g., “Dodoose” corrected to “Dedoose”).\n\nText Standardization and Formatting Summarize standardization steps for readability and consistency:\n\nWas text converted to lowercase? Was spelling corrected? If so, did you preserve participant colloquialisms? Were consistent punctuation and spacing applied? Example: Converted all text to lowercase for consistency. Standardized punctuation (e.g., added periods to sentence ends where missing). Corrected spelling errors that obscured meaning but preserved participant vernacular and tone where appropriate.\n\nMetadata or Contextual Information Added Note any metadata added to support analysis:\n\nSession name (e.g., “Educators” vs. “Public Health Professionals”) Discussion section (e.g., “Challenges,” “Recommendations”) Participant role or group designation Example: Added metadata fields to identify Session Name, Participant Group (Educator/Public Health), and Discussion Section (Barriers, Facilitators, Recommendations).\n\nKey Decisions Made During Cleaning Flag any important decisions that could impact analysis:\n\nIf you excluded any portions of text (e.g., off-topic discussions), document what was excluded and why. If you made choices about retaining or removing interruptions, overlapping speech, or non-verbal cues, describe the rationale. If you generalized identifying details in ways that may impact interpretation, note this. Example: Excluded introductory small talk (greetings, logistics discussions) from the analysis dataset. Retained overlapping speech where relevant to the discussion. Generalized certain job titles to preserve anonymity (e.g., “Head Nurse” changed to “Medical Staff”).\n\nCounts and Summaries Where Relevant When helpful, include counts that summarize:\n\nHow many identifiers were removed? How many sessions, speakers, or responses are in the final dataset? If you organized by themes, how many segments are in each theme? Example: Final cleaned dataset includes 8 focus groups, 42 participants, and 620 participant responses across three discussion sections: Challenges (n = 220), Facilitators (n = 200), and Recommendations (n = 200).\n💡 Tips for Reporting Qualitative Data Cleaning Be Transparent Even small decisions (e.g., standardizing speaker labels) can have big implications during analysis. If you’re unsure whether to document something, document it!\nTake the Perspective of Your Project Lead or Analyst What decisions might they need to revisit later? What context would help them understand how the data were shaped?\nSupport Replicability and Quality Control Your cleaning report should make it easy for another team member to:\nUnderstand what was done Re-run the cleaning script Suggest or request changes with full knowledge of the process 🖼️ Example Summary Table in a Qualitative Cleaning Report Cleaning Step Action Taken Notes Anonymization Removed names, replaced with Participant IDs (P01-P42) Locations and job titles generalized Speaker Labeling Labeled as Facilitator or Participant Consistent across all sessions Timestamps Removed Deleted all timestamps (hh:mm:ss)\nFiller Words Removed “um,” “uh” except when indicating hesitation Case-by-case review Text Standardization Converted to lowercase, corrected major spelling errors Preserved participant language/tone Metadata Added Session name, participant group, discussion section Useful for subgroup analysis Exclusions Removed introductions, off-topic discussions Documented in the data log"

Transcripts may include speaker labels, timestamps, and other artifacts that need cleaning.\nTurn-Taking Each time a participant or facilitator speaks is called a “turn.” Clean data often organize these turns into individual rows in a dataset.\nSegment (or Excerpt) A portion of text, such as a paragraph, sentence, or speaker turn, treated as a unit for coding or analysis. Segments are often defined by the speaker’s response or by topic.\nTidy Data Data where:\nEach row represents a single observation (e.g., a speaker turn or segment) Each column contains one type of information (e.g., speaker ID, text, session group) Tidy data make it easier to manipulate, clean, and analyze qualitative datasets in R. Rectangular Data Another term for a table or data frame, where rows and columns are used to organize data in R.\n🗂️ Qualitative Metadata & Labeling Terms Speaker Label An identifier showing who is speaking (e.g., “Facilitator,” “Participant 1”). Clean data should use consistent speaker labels.\nParticipant ID A unique identifier assigned to participants to protect anonymity (e.g., “P01”). These are often used in place of names.\nSession ID / Group The label identifying the specific interview or focus group a participant was part of (e.g., “Session 1 – Educators”).\nDiscussion Section / Topic Area A label identifying a portion of the conversation (e.g., “Barriers,” “Recommendations”) to help organize qualitative data.\n✂️ Data Cleaning & Transformation Terms Anonymization / De-Identification The process of removing or replacing personal identifiers (e.g., names, locations, job titles) to protect participant privacy.\nStandardization Making text consistent in format (e.g., converting to lowercase, consistent punctuation, spacing).\nTokenization (Optional depending on your analysis!) Breaking down text into smaller parts—words, sentences, or phrases—typically for text mining. Not always part of standard qualitative coding workflows.\nFiltering Removing unnecessary rows or segments (e.g., small talk, off-topic responses) from the data.\nRecoding Transforming data from one format to another (e.g., generalizing job titles or grouping participant roles).\nJoin / Merge Combining two datasets based on a shared key (e.g., merging participant demographic info with transcripts).\nPivoting Restructuring data from wide format (many columns) to long format (many rows), or vice versa, to make it easier to analyze or display.\n🏷️ Text Cleaning Terms Timestamps Time markers in transcripts (e.g., [00:12:34]) that need to be removed unless necessary for the analysis.\nFiller Words Common speech disfluencies (e.g., “um,” “uh,” “like”) that can be removed for clarity, depending on analysis goals.\nInaudibles / Transcription Errors Markers like “[inaudible]” or machine transcription errors that need to be corrected or flagged.\nSpelling and Grammar Standardization Correcting spelling errors that make text difficult to read, while preserving participant voice and tone where relevant."

    "section": "Reading your data into R",
    "text": "Reading your data into R\nFirst, we’ll need to read our data into R. Depending on how your raw text is stored, you’ll need to take various steps to read in your data for analysis. The goal is to turn any of your text into a dataframe with rows and columns of your text responses. In some cases, you may need to keep participant ID columns or other columns if you’re doing a mixed-method analysis. In other cases, you may be analyzing different focus groups and comparing them to eachother. Whatever you are doing, make sure your dataframe is set up or your analysis. If you are unsure about this, ask Hannah or a member of Qual BPT for some help!\nHere is an example of what your data may look like when you first read it into R.\n\nand here’s what we want it to look like (eventually) for most of our analysis needs.\n\nWith clean data, we can:\n\nCompare participants’ responses across sessions and discussion sections. We could answer questions like:\n\nWhat did Educators say about Community Impact vs. Public Health?”\nWhat did participants across all interviews think about abatement funds?\n\nFilter by participant role (e.g., facilitators vs. participants) for targeted analysis. We could answer questions like:\n\nHow many participants mentioned that the county should invest in wraparound services across all interviews?\nWhat is the most common barrier in accessing services in the county?\n\nPreserve anonymity by removing names and identifiers.\n\n\nZoom transcripts\nOne of the main forms of qualitative data we receive includes Zoom transcripts. Below is a function you can use to clean your Zoom transcripts and get them to a tidy format by entering the interviewer name(s), and key phrases used by the interviewer to mark the section of the discussion. For example, an interview might begin with an introduction, then include a discussion of barriers, and a discussion of strengths. We’ll likely want to separate these out into sections so our analyses can speak to each section independent of each other, rather than be clumped altogether.\nAnd when you want to clean the transcripts and mark the interviewer, you can add the names of the interviewers here.\nThis function works for Zoom transcripts that are saved as Word documents or .txt files. There are few things you need to specify in the function, including updating the file path, the interviewers, setting your list of questions, adding section labels, and the session name.\nThis example comes from the Loudoun County Opioid Abatement project where Shon, Lindsay, Hannah, Luke, Eden, and Arden are staffed, so any of them could have been an interviewer.\n@QUALBPT is there anything listed here that may be helpful to add that we might want to analyze or examine? @QUALBPT is there ever a case where we would need to analyze the interviewer’s language?\nIn the case where an interviewer asks a question an exact way, we can enter the question as it is listed on the interview guide. However, this is not always the best way to run an interview when you’re following a more relaxed vibe. So, it may be helpful to have the interview guide (or deck, whatever the interviewer used to facilitate the discussion) and the transcript opened to identify the order of discussion and section labels, and to identify where those key markers of the text are going to identify your questions.\nWhat is a good example of a question list if the interviewer did not read the question verbatim? Let’s imagine the first question listed on the interview guide is “What kinds of barriers do you think prevent community members from accessing services in the county?”.\nBad example: “accessing services” this is a bad example because this phrase has been marked as an identifier for a question, so any instance of “accessing services” comes up will count the phrase as a question.\nGood example: “barriers do you think prevent community members from accessing services” it is less likely for someone to have used this exact string of words in the conversation, so we’re safe to mark this as a question identifier.\n\n\nPDFs\n\n\nExcel sheets\nOf course, we also tend to ask qualitative questions in some of our surveys at OMNI, and these types of data should be read in like quantitative data and should already be in a clean format if you follow the data cleaning guide (insert link to data cleaning guide).\n\n\n@QUALBPT Any other forms of text we use?"

Because we want to focus on broader themes from our participants’ voices, we usually want to remove stop words after text is tokenized. This process allows us to focus on content-rich words, like nouns and verbs.

    "text": "Word frequency analysis\n\n\n\n\nWord frequency analysis is a simple and effective method that counts how often specific words appear in your dataset. It’s often used early in qualitative analysis to get a general sense of prominent topics, but it can also be applied as a stand-alone method to identify frequently mentioned issues in participant responses. Word frequency works best when you have a reasonable amount of text to analyze. As a general best practice, having at least 100–200 content words (excluding stop words) allows for more reliable interpretation of patterns, though smaller datasets can still offer preliminary insights.\nTo ensure accuracy, it’s important to pre-process your text. Using lemmatized words helps avoid counting variations like “run” and “running” separately, and removing stop words—common words such as “the” or “and”—allows you to focus on terms that carry more meaning. In cases where participants mention names of places or projects repeatedly, custom stop word lists can also help refine the results.\n\n\nWhile word frequency counts themselves do not explain context or meaning, they can help point to emerging themes by highlighting concepts that recur across participants or within particular sections of discussion. For example, if words like “transportation,” “access,” and “barrier” frequently appear in responses about service challenges, they signal a potential theme that warrants deeper exploration. Word frequency analysis can also help guide more interpretive methods such as thematic or content analysis, and is most useful when findings are contextualized within the broader dataset and research goals.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  word             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 time             4\n2 people           3\n3 access           2\n4 application      2\n5 applications     2\n6 process          2"

    "text": "Sentiment analysis\nSentiment analysis is a method that measures the emotional tone of text by categorizing words or phrases as positive, negative, or neutral. It can be used to quickly gauge participants’ attitudes toward a topic or to assess the overall tone of responses across interviews, focus groups, or surveys. Sentiment analysis works best when you have larger amounts of text—ideally, datasets with several hundred words or more—because emotional tone can vary within short responses, making sentiment harder to interpret in very small datasets. However, it can still offer insights in smaller datasets when applied carefully and when results are presented as exploratory.\nBest practices for sentiment analysis include pre-processing your text by removing stop words and standardizing language through lemmatization. This ensures consistent scoring and avoids misclassifications due to word variations. Sentiment analysis typically relies on pre-built lexicons, such as Bing, AFINN, or the NRC Emotion Lexicon, which assign emotional values to words. It’s important to note that these lexicons were often designed for general use (such as social media text) and may require customization to fit specific public health or social science contexts. For example, in health-related interviews, a word like “treatment” might appear frequently and carry different sentiment depending on the discussion’s focus.\nWhile sentiment analysis doesn’t capture nuance or context in the way manual coding can, it can highlight patterns of emotional tone across datasets or within specific discussion topics. For example, sentiment analysis might reveal that participants express more negative sentiment when discussing barriers to accessing services, and more positive sentiment when discussing recommendations for future improvements. These insights can help guide deeper qualitative coding or serve as an additional layer of analysis to support findings. As with any automated method, it’s important to review and interpret results in context and to document any limitations or adaptations made to the analysis.\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sentiment     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 negative      5\n2 positive      3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip for finding quotes by tone\nLet’s say you want to pull a quote to include in a report and you know that you want it to be a positively toned quote in a “recommendations” section of your discussion. You can use the sentimentr package to gather sentiments of each sentence (or segment) and sort by sentiment score to find the quote with the most positive tone in your criteria.\nSee an example below:\n\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 12\n   line speaker     participant_id question section section_label  text  session\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1     2 participant P1                    0       1 Introduction   sure… Educat…\n2     3 participant P2                    0       1 Introduction   i ag… Educat…\n3     5 participant P1                    0       2 Barriers       trav… Educat…\n4     6 participant P2                    0       2 Barriers       also… Public…\n5     8 participant P1                    0       3 Recommendatio… more… Public…\n6     9 participant P2                    0       3 Recommendatio… simp… Public…\n7    10 participant P1                    0       3 Recommendatio… prov… Public…\n# ℹ 4 more variables: element_id &lt;int&gt;, avg_sentiment &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   sd_sentiment &lt;dbl&gt;, n_sentences &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nMixed-methods with sentiment analysis\nBecause sentiment analysis gives you a numeric output as a sentiment score, you can imagine instances where you may want to compare sentiment scores between groups, correlate sentiment scores with other variables in a quantitative survey, or conduct pre-post comparisons."

    "section": "Topic modeling",
    "text": "Topic modeling\nTopic modeling is an automated method used to identify themes or topics across large collections of text. It uses algorithms to group together words that frequently appear in similar contexts, helping reveal hidden patterns or structures in qualitative data. Topic modeling is especially useful when you have large datasets—typically a minimum of 5,000 words or more spread across multiple documents or participant responses. The method works best when documents are of relatively similar length, which helps the model assign topics more evenly.\nThis method is not recommended for use on smaller corpuses and would be considered poor practice to rely on it to generate meaningful insights. If you don’t have enough data for this analysis, consider using the content analysis strategy to identify themes in the data.\nBefore running a topic model, it’s important to pre-process your text. Best practices include stemming words to reduce variation (so that “run” and “running” are treated as the same word) and removing stop words to focus on meaningful content. Topic modeling doesn’t require predefined codes or themes, making it a good exploratory tool for surfacing unexpected topics in your data. However, it’s important to remember that these topics are generated algorithmically—they group terms based on statistical patterns, not human interpretation. As a result, human review is always needed to interpret and label the topics in a way that makes sense for your project and participants.\nTopic modeling can complement manual coding by offering a high-level view of common themes, pointing analysts toward areas that may warrant deeper exploration. For example, a topic model might surface clusters of words related to barriers (“transportation,” “access,” “cost”) and another cluster about solutions (“education,” “outreach,” “support”), giving you a starting point for thematic analysis. Commonly used R packages for topic modeling include topicmodels, which provides algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and tm for pre-processing and managing textual data.\n\n\n[1] 46.1033\n\n\n[1] 46.13593\n\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n# Groups:   topic [2]\n   topic term             beta\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 time           0.0617\n 2     1 transportation 0.0544\n 3     1 services       0.0467\n 4     1 residents      0.0313\n 5     1 challenges     0.0297\n 6     1 agree          0.0281\n 7     1 lot            0.0278\n 8     1 access         0.0276\n 9     1 applications   0.0275\n10     1 application    0.0274\n11     2 people         0.0800\n12     2 time           0.0695\n13     2 process        0.0485\n14     2 application    0.0381\n15     2 applications   0.0381\n16     2 access         0.0380\n17     2 timeconsuming  0.0264\n18     2 campaigns      0.0260\n19     2 buses          0.0254\n20     2 simplifying    0.0253\n\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 3\n# Groups:   topic [3]\n   topic term             beta\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 time           0.0778\n 2     1 transportation 0.0543\n 3     1 services       0.0542\n 4     1 lot            0.0390\n 5     1 residents      0.0353\n 6     1 applications   0.0347\n 7     1 access         0.0312\n 8     1 vouchers       0.0261\n 9     1 makes          0.0256\n10     1 planning       0.0249\n# ℹ 20 more rows"

    "text": "Content analysis\nContent analysis is a method used to count how often predefined concepts, themes, or categories appear in qualitative data. It relies on a dictionary—a list of key terms or phrases—designed to reflect your evaluation questions or coding framework. Content analysis works well for both small and large datasets, making it a flexible tool when you want to systematically measure the presence of specific themes across interviews, focus groups, or open-ended survey responses.\nA key requirement for effective content analysis is a carefully designed dictionary that accurately captures the concepts you’re interested in. This might include terms related to barriers, facilitators, or recommendations, depending on the project’s goals. Best practice is to validate the dictionary by reviewing examples of matched text to make sure the terms are identifying the intended content. You may need to refine the dictionary over time, adding synonyms or removing words that generate false positives.\nContent analysis can help answer questions like “How frequently do participants mention prevention strategies?” or “What percentage of responses reference funding challenges?” It is particularly useful when you need to quantify qualitative data for reporting purposes, or when you want to compare how frequently themes appear across different stakeholder groups. In R, the quanteda package offers efficient tools for dictionary-based content analysis, allowing you to apply a dictionary and quickly summarize how often key terms or concepts appear in the dataset.\n\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 7 documents, 109 features (81.26% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    sure i think one of the biggest challenges is transportation\n  text1    1 1     1   1  5   2       1          1  1              1\n  text2    0 1     0   0  0   0       0          0  0              0\n  text3    0 0     0   0  1   0       0          0  0              0\n  text4    0 0     0   0  0   4       0          0  1              0\n  text5    0 0     0   0  0   0       0          0  0              0\n  text6    0 0     0   0  0   1       0          0  0              0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 1 more document, reached max_nfeat ... 99 more features ]\n\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 7 documents, 3 features (85.71% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    prevention treatment harm_reduction\n  text1          0         1              0\n  text2          0         0              0\n  text3          1         0              0\n  text4          0         0              0\n  text5          2         0              0\n  text6          0         0              0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 1 more document ]\n\n\n[1] \"text1\" \"text2\" \"text3\" \"text4\" \"text5\" \"text6\"\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n   line speaker     participant_id question section section_label  text  session\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1     2 participant P1                    0       1 Introduction   sure… Educat…\n2     3 participant P2                    0       1 Introduction   i ag… Educat…\n3     5 participant P1                    0       2 Barriers       trav… Educat…\n4     6 participant P2                    0       2 Barriers       also… Public…\n5     8 participant P1                    0       3 Recommendatio… more… Public…\n6     9 participant P2                    0       3 Recommendatio… simp… Public…\n# ℹ 4 more variables: doc_id &lt;chr&gt;, prevention &lt;dbl&gt;, treatment &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   harm_reduction &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "Introduction\nData cleaning is often one of the first things you will do when you start working with qualitative data at Omni. Whether we’re working with interview transcripts, focus group discussions, or open-ended survey responses, the raw data we receive is rarely ready for immediate analysis. Cleaning is not just about tidying up; it’s about making informed decisions that clarify the meaning and integrity of the data while preparing it for systematic analysis.\nThe decisions we make during the cleaning process are every bit as complex and impactful as those made during coding and analysis. Thoughtful data cleaning can preserve the richness of qualitative data, while careless decisions can distort or diminish participants’ voices. Therefore, it is especially important to have a strong set of working principles to guide your decisions when cleaning qualitative data.\nThis guide covers a general approach to qualitative data cleaning, with an emphasis on useful R packages and functions designed to conquer some common challenges. While this guide includes tools and code to make your life easier, it also offers guidelines for making judgment calls about what to remove, retain, or clarify in the data.\nThe steps in a qualitative data cleaning process will always be informed by two key factors:\n\nThe state of the data when we (Omni) receive it\n\n\nFor example, some transcripts may come from automated services (like Zoom or Otter.ai) and contain timestamps, speaker labels, or filler words that require removal. Others may be professionally transcribed and need minimal cleaning.\n\n\nThe specific needs of the project\n\n\nBecause of this variability, we encourage a flexible, judgment-driven approach to data cleaning. The steps described in this guide are common to many projects, but their order and application should be tailored to the needs of the dataset and the analytic goals of the project. Importantly, depending on the type of analysis, different cleaning steps may be required. Consult the analysis plan and research questions in your project materials to verify the needs of the project."

    "text": "Rationale\nWhen we clean qualitative data, we apply a series of thoughtful transformations that make the data clearer, more consistent, and usable for analysis. Qualitative data cleaning requires attention to detail and sensitivity to the context in which the data were collected. The procedures we use need to be flexible because the downstream purposes of the data can vary from project to project, whether for thematic coding, content analysis, or mixed-methods integration.\nThe qualitative data cleaner often has to make many judgment calls during this process. These decisions are guided by the project’s goals, the nature of the source data, team experience, and guidance documents (like this one). Every decision and its rationale should be clearly documented in the data cleaning script or data log (more on that below). Transparency in this process ensures that the cleaned dataset remains trustworthy and aligned with our ethical standards for qualitative research.\nQualitative data cleaning requires a lot of careful thought and attention. The R code that cleans text data needs to be clearly written and well-commented, not only for reproducibility but to ensure that meaning is preserved, and participant voices are not inadvertently altered or diminished. In qualitative work, the cleaning process can directly impact the integrity of the analysis.\nJust as with quantitative analysis, qualitative data-cleaning decisions are made with greater ease and clarity when there is a clear work plan, guided by the project’s research questions or evaluation goals. Having a shared understanding of what the team hopes to explore in the data helps inform:\n\nWhat should be cleaned\nWhat should be preserved (even if messy)\nWhat should be flagged for discussion\n\nFinally, whether you’re writing code for qualitative data cleaning or any other purpose, always write your R scripts as if they will later be:\n\nHeavily scrutinized\nHeld up as example code\nModified by someone brand new to both R and the project\n\nMake it easy on future Omni-ites—and on your future self!"

This can be done by adding question text as its own field in the dataset or by adding markers in the transcript.\n\n\nText Segments Are Ordered and Organized\n\n\nThe transcript text is ordered according to the flow of conversation. Segments are correctly time-sequenced (even if timestamps themselves are removed).\n\n\nText Is Structured Into a Tidy, Rectangular Format\n\n\nEach row represents a single speaker turn or unit of analysis (e.g., a complete response to a question).\nData are stored in a rectangular table (data frame), with columns for:\n\nSession name or group (e.g., “Educators” or “Public Health”)\nParticipant ID or role (e.g., “Participant 1”, “Facilitator”)\nText segment (the response or comment)\nAny relevant metadata (e.g., discussion section, date)\nTranscription\n\n\n\nArtifacts Are Removed\n\n\nAll timestamps (e.g., [00:05:23], (0:12:45)) are deleted unless specifically required for analysis.\nAutomated transcription quirks (e.g., repeated words, filler words, auto-captions like “[inaudible]”) are reviewed, cleaned, or flagged.\n\n\nText Is Consistent in Style and Format\n\n\nAll text is converted to lowercase, unless case is important for analysis.\nSpelling errors are corrected when they obscure meaning (but regional spellings or participant quirks may be preserved if relevant).\nPunctuation and spacing are standardized (no excessive whitespace, missing periods, etc.).\n\n\nRelevant Identifiers Are Added to the Dataset\n\n\nIf there are multiple sessions or groups, these are labeled (e.g., “Educators,” “Public Health”).\nIf there are themes or discussion sections (e.g., “Challenges,” “Recommendations”), these are identified.\nIf codes are pre-assigned for analytic purposes (e.g., “Pre-implementation,” “Post-implementation”), they are included in the data structure.\n\nHow Do We Know When Qualitative Data Are Clean?\nHere are some guiding questions to help determine when qualitative data are ready for analysis (i.e., clean):\n\nWhat is the plan for coding or analyzing this data?\nThe analysis plan (or coding framework) should inform cleaning decisions. For example, if the team plans to do thematic coding, they’ll need text organized into meaningful speaker turns or responses. What needs to be anonymized?\nIdentify any sensitive information that must be redacted or replaced to maintain confidentiality and ensure participant privacy. Are speaker turns properly attributed and easy to follow?\nEach speaker’s contributions should be clearly labeled, consistently formatted, and grouped logically. Are responses to specific questions clearly identifiable?\nIf interviews or focus groups follow a semi-structured guide, it’s important to separate questions from responses for clarity in analysis. Is the structure of the data appropriate for the analytic tool?\nIf the data are being uploaded to Dedoose, NVivo, or another platform, they should follow the required format (e.g., tidy data frame with speaker IDs and group names). Have all unnecessary artifacts been removed?\nTime stamps, filler words, and transcription errors that don’t add value to the analysis should be removed. Has the cleaned data been reviewed by someone else (QA check)?\nWhenever possible, have another Omni-ite review the cleaned data for accuracy and completeness.\n\nCommon Issues to Discuss Early in the Cleaning Process\nJust like in quantitative data cleaning, clarifying expectations at the start of a project will save time later. For qualitative projects, consider these:\n\nWill we analyze both facilitator questions and participant responses, or just participant responses?\nHow will we handle overlapping speech, interruptions, or incomplete thoughts?\nDo we need to standardize participant roles (e.g., “Public Health Official” vs. “PH Staff”) for consistency?\nAre we preparing data for manual coding or automated text analysis?\nDo we need to translate or transcribe non-English responses?\nDo we need to connect text segments with broader context, such as the discussion theme or section of the focus group?\n\nQuick Summary of “Clean Qualitative Data” at Omni: Clean qualitative data are:\n\nAnonymized\nClearly structured and labeled\nOrganized for easy analysis\nFree of unnecessary artifacts\nReady for use in coding and interpretation"

    "text": "How do I report the results of data cleaning?\nCleaning qualitative data is an interpretive and decision-heavy process, and those decisions need to be transparent. Reporting your cleaning process helps:\nProject leads understand what’s been done and why. Provide documentation in case changes need to be made later. Build trust in the integrity of the cleaned dataset. Support future qualitative coding, interpretation, and reporting. Qualitative data cleaning produces results—changes to the text or data structure—that should be documented in a clear, shareable data cleaning report.\nWhat to include in a report about qualitative data cleaning\n\nSummary of the Dataset You Cleaned Start with an overview:\n\nHow many transcripts or files were cleaned? How many sessions (e.g., focus groups, interviews) are included? What types of participants are represented (e.g., educators, public health professionals)?\nExample: This dataset includes transcripts from 8 focus groups, with 42 participants. Participants represent two stakeholder groups: Educators (n = 20) and Public Health Professionals (n = 22).\n\nAnonymization and De-Identification Steps Document what you removed or replaced to protect confidentiality.\n\nWere participant names replaced with IDs (e.g., Participant 01)? Were organizations, locations, or personal identifiers removed or redacted? Were job titles generalized (e.g., “CEO” changed to “senior leader”)?\nExample: Replaced all participant names with Participant IDs (e.g., P01). Removed specific references to organizations and locations (e.g., “at Boulder Community Hospital” becomes “at [hospital]”). Redacted job titles for anonymity when mentioned alongside unique organizations.\n\nSpeaker Labeling and Text Structuring Describe how speakers were labeled and how the transcript was organized.\n\nWere speakers consistently labeled as “Participant” and “Facilitator”? Was each speaker turn separated into its own row or segment? Were questions separated from responses?\nExample: Speaker turns were labeled consistently as either Facilitator or Participant. Each speaker turn is stored as one row in the cleaned dataset, with associated metadata (Session name, Speaker role, Discussion section).\n\nArtifacts Removed (Timestamps, Filler Words, etc.) Note what transcription artifacts were removed or edited:\n\nWere timestamps deleted? Were filler words (e.g., “um,” “uh”) removed? If so, specify whether this was systematic or case-by-case. Were transcription errors corrected?\nExample: Removed all timestamps in the format [hh:mm:ss]. Deleted common filler words (“um,” “uh”) unless they contributed to participant meaning or tone. Reviewed and corrected auto-transcription errors (e.g., “Dodoose” corrected to “Dedoose”).\n\nText Standardization and Formatting Summarize standardization steps for readability and consistency:\n\nWas text converted to lowercase? Was spelling corrected? If so, did you preserve participant colloquialisms? Were consistent punctuation and spacing applied?\nExample: Converted all text to lowercase for consistency. Standardized punctuation (e.g., added periods to sentence ends where missing). Corrected spelling errors that obscured meaning but preserved participant vernacular and tone where appropriate.\n\nMetadata or Contextual Information Added Note any metadata added to support analysis:\n\nSession name (e.g., “Educators” vs. “Public Health Professionals”) Discussion section (e.g., “Challenges,” “Recommendations”) Participant role or group designation\nExample: Added metadata fields to identify Session Name, Participant Group (Educator/Public Health), and Discussion Section (Barriers, Facilitators, Recommendations).\n\nKey Decisions Made During Cleaning Flag any important decisions that could impact analysis:\n\nIf you excluded any portions of text (e.g., off-topic discussions), document what was excluded and why. If you made choices about retaining or removing interruptions, overlapping speech, or non-verbal cues, describe the rationale. If you generalized identifying details in ways that may impact interpretation, note this.\nExample: Excluded introductory small talk (greetings, logistics discussions) from the analysis dataset. Retained overlapping speech where relevant to the discussion. Generalized certain job titles to preserve anonymity (e.g., “Head Nurse” changed to “Medical Staff”).\n\nCounts and Summaries Where Relevant When helpful, include counts that summarize:\n\nHow many identifiers were removed? How many sessions, speakers, or responses are in the final dataset? If you organized by themes, how many segments are in each theme?\nExample: Final cleaned dataset includes 8 focus groups, 42 participants, and 620 participant responses across three discussion sections: Challenges (n = 220), Facilitators (n = 200), and Recommendations (n = 200).\nTips for reporting qualitative data cleaning be transparent\n\nEven small decisions (e.g., standardizing speaker labels) can have big implications during analysis. If you’re unsure whether to document something, document it!\nTake the perspective of your project lead or analyst. What decisions might they need to revisit later? What context would help them understand how the data were shaped?\nSupport replicability and quality control. Your cleaning report should make it easy for another team member to:\n\nUnderstand what was done\nRe-run the cleaning script\nSuggest or request changes with full knowledge of the process\n\n\nExample summary table to describe data cleaning for reporting\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning Step\nAction Taken\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nAnonymization\nRemoved names; replaced with Participant IDs (P01–P42).\nLocations and job titles generalized.\n\n\nSpeaker Labeling\nLabeled as Facilitator or Participant.\nConsistent across all sessions.\n\n\nTimestamps Removed\nDeleted all timestamps (hh:mm:ss).\n\n\n\nFiller Words Removed\nRemoved “um,” “uh” except when indicating hesitation.\nCase-by-case review.\n\n\nText Standardization\nConverted to lowercase; corrected major spelling errors.\nPreserved participant language and tone.\n\n\nMetadata Added\nAdded session name, participant group, and discussion section.\nUseful for subgroup analysis.\n\n\nExclusions\nRemoved introductions and off-topic discussions.\nDocumented in the data log."

Transcripts may include speaker labels, timestamps, and other artifacts that need cleaning.\nTurn-Taking: Each time a participant or facilitator speaks is called a “turn.” Clean data often organize these turns into individual rows in a dataset.\nSegment (or Excerpt): A portion of text, such as a paragraph, sentence, or speaker turn, treated as a unit for coding or analysis. Segments are often defined by the speaker’s response or by topic.\nTidy Data: Data where:\n\nEach row represents a single observation (e.g., a speaker turn or segment)\nEach column contains one type of information (e.g., speaker ID, text, session group)\nTidy data make it easier to manipulate, clean, and analyze qualitative datasets in R.\n\nRectangular Data: Another term for a table or data frame, where rows and columns are used to organize data in R.\n\n🗂️ Qualitative Metadata & Labeling Term\n\nSpeaker Label: An identifier showing who is speaking (e.g., “Facilitator,” “Participant 1”). Clean data should use consistent speaker labels.\nParticipant ID: A unique identifier assigned to participants to protect anonymity (e.g., “P01”). These are often used in place of names.\nSession ID/Group: The label identifying the specific interview or focus group a participant was part of (e.g., “Session 1 – Educators”).\nDiscussion Section/Topic Area: A label identifying a portion of the conversation (e.g., “Barriers,” “Recommendations”) to help organize qualitative data.\n\n✂️ Data Cleaning & Transformation Terms\n\nAnonymization/De-Identification: The process of removing or replacing personal identifiers (e.g., names, locations, job titles) to protect participant privacy.\nStandardization: Making text consistent in format (e.g., converting to lowercase, consistent punctuation, spacing).\nTokenization: (Optional depending on your analysis!) Breaking down text into smaller parts—words, sentences, or phrases—typically for text mining. Not always part of standard qualitative coding workflows.\nFiltering: Removing unnecessary rows or segments (e.g., small talk, off-topic responses) from the data.\nRecoding: Transforming data from one format to another (e.g., generalizing job titles or grouping participant roles).\nJoin/Merge: Combining two datasets based on a shared key (e.g., merging participant demographic info with transcripts).\nPivoting: Restructuring data from wide format (many columns) to long format (many rows), or vice versa, to make it easier to analyze or display.\n\n🏷️ Text Cleaning Terms\n\nTimestamps: Time markers in transcripts (e.g., [00:12:34]) that need to be removed unless necessary for the analysis.\nFiller Words: Common speech disfluencies (e.g., “um,” “uh,” “like”) that can be removed for clarity, depending on analysis goals.\nInaudibles/Transcription Errors: Markers like “[inaudible]” or machine transcription errors that need to be corrected or flagged.\nSpelling and Grammar Standardization: Correcting spelling errors that make text difficult to read, while preserving participant voice and tone where relevant."

The goal is to turn any of your text into a dataframe with rows and columns of your text responses. In some cases, you may need to keep participant ID columns or other columns if you’re doing a mixed-method analysis. In other cases, you may be analyzing different focus groups and comparing them to eachother. Whatever you are doing, make sure your dataframe is set up or your analysis. If you are unsure about this, ask a member of Qual BPT for some help!\nHere is an example of what your data may look like when you first read it into R.\n\nand here’s what we want it to look like (eventually) for most of our analysis needs.\n\nWith clean data, we can:\n\nCompare participants’ responses across sessions and discussion sections. We could answer questions like:\n\nWhat did Educators say about Community Impact vs. Public Health?”\nWhat did participants across all interviews think about abatement funds?\n\nFilter by participant role (e.g., facilitators vs. participants) for targeted analysis. We could answer questions like:\n\nHow many participants mentioned that the county should invest in wraparound services across all interviews?\nWhat is the most common barrier in accessing services in the county?\n\nPreserve anonymity by removing names and identifiers."

    "text": "Omni’s core value of #accountability ensures that all of the work we do promotes accuracy, is transparent, and represents the lived experiences of our partners and the communities that we work with. Within the qualitative work that we do, this means that we keep detailed notes about 1) our coding decisions, 2) what those codes mean, and 3) how these codes build to the bigger picture in our analysis. Key to ensuring that we remain #accountable in our work, is the development of a codebook for every qualitative analysis conducted at Omni. Doing so is in alignment with Omni’s Fundamental Qualitative Standards and can lead to smoother, more transparent qualitative analyses and writeups.\nBelow you will find an example codebook template, an annotated codebook example, and a filled out codebook example. Every project at Omni that involves a qualitative analysis must include a fully-completed codebook that lives somewhere in the project’s space, either within Confluence or Dropbox. Codebooks should be accessible to the entire team, not just those conducting the analysis, and it is recommended that the codebook is shared in spaces alongside other key project information (i.e., Trello, Confluence main pages).\nNote: The structures of a codebook may change depending on the type of analysis that is completed. For example, if we are doing a content analysis, then we will not need the theme or theme description columns. You are also welcome to add additional columns with relevant information, such as notes, memos, and inclusion/exclusion criteria. It is important to ensure that the codes and their definitions remain clear, so we caution against including too much additional information. In rare instances, codebooks may be a deliverable on a project. In these instance, speak to the client about what they would like to have included. An example of a codebook deliverable can be found here."

For project teams that will be using Dedoose, it may be helpful to opt for a structure that allows for easy importing and exporting of codes. In order to import your codes, Dedoose requires an Excel spreadsheet with the following column headings: Id, Parent Id, Title, Description, Weighted, Weight Minimum, Weight Maximum, and Weight Default.\nTo note, while this is helpful for ease of use in Dedoose, a codebook structured in this way will not likely be clear for clients or for new team members. Because of this, we recommend using this structure to import your codes into Dedoose AND then using Omni’s codebook template as you are coding your data to ensure that you have a clear and transparent codebook.\nMore information on the code import process for Dedoose can be found on their help page."

    "text": "Omni’s Approach to Analysis\nOmni’s qualitative practice is grounded in pragmatism and critical realism.\n\nPragmatism means we focus on providing useful, actionable insights for real-world decision-making. Our goal is to help clients understand participants’ experiences in ways that inform policy, programs, and practice. This reflects a pragmatic stance rooted in the work of scholars like  Morgan (2007)  and  Danermark et al. (2015) , emphasizing inquiry that is guided by consequences and utility.\nCritical realism acknowledges that while participants’ experiences reflect real phenomena (barriers, challenges, successes), they are shaped by context and perspective. Influenced by  Fletcher’s (2017)  work and work by others, this perspective guides us to acknowledge our limitations, reflect on researcher influence, and avoid overstating claims.\nOmni’s qualitative practice draws on reflexive thematic analysis  (Clarke & Braun, 2006)  and content analysis  (Hseih & Shannon, 2005) , emphasizing the researcher’s active role in interpreting data and constructing themes, in alignment with our commitment to critical realism and methodological transparency.\n\n\nTransparent and Systematic Workflows\nAt Omni, we use structured qualitative and mixed-methods workflows. These processes are transparent, systematic, and designed to integrate qualitative and quantitative findings when appropriate.\n\nExample Omni Workflow for Qualitative analysis:\n\nClarify Purpose and Analytic Framework\n\n\nDefine the evaluation questions and purpose of the qualitative analysis\nSelect an analytic method\n\n\nPrepare and Familiarize with the Data\n\n\nClean transcripts/text\nRead through interviews, discussions, or sessions at least once (text like reports you may not need context for, use your discretion)\n\n\nSystematic Coding of the Data\n\n\nDeductive, Inductive, or hybrid\nDeductive coding uses predefined codes (like our dictionaries) to apply to our data\nInductive coding uses text mining or topic modeling to identify emergent themes\n\n\nTheme Development and Refinement\n\n\nAnalyze and refine codes/themes\n\n\nInterpretation and Synthesis\n\n\nCompare themes to evaluation questions and contextual frameworks\n\n\nExplore themes visually\nGet ready for reporting"

Take time to understand:\n\nHow many participants are included?\nHow much text do you have (word count, number of responses)?\nHow detailed are the responses (in-depth vs. brief)?\nHow are participants grouped (by stakeholder type, session, etc.)?\nWhose voices are most important to elevate in this analysis?\n\nThis step ensures you choose methods that fit your dataset and align with your project goals. For example:\n\nSmaller datasets (under ~2,000 words) are well-suited to word frequency, sentiment analysis, or basic content analysis.\nLarger datasets (5,000+ words) can support topic modeling or advanced thematic analysis.\n\nAssessing your data upfront helps set realistic expectations for analysis and ensures your findings are grounded, transparent, and defensible.\n\n\nWorking with a Small Corpus\nAt Omni, qualitative research often happens in real-world settings, with tight timelines and limited participant availability. We may aim for 10 interviews and complete 5. We may expect long, detailed conversations and instead get brief answers. Even with these constraints, small datasets can still provide meaningful insights, especially when there is consistency across participant experiences.\nWhen working with limited data:\n\nFocus on what participants actually shared, rather than attempting to generalize.\nDocument patterns and recurring concerns, while linking them clearly to the project’s research questions.\nBe transparent about the number of participants, the methods used, and any limitations in interpretation.\n\nSmaller samples can still highlight critical issues—such as barriers to access or common recommendations for program improvement—but the scope and representativeness of these findings should be clearly communicated.\n\n\nSuggested Methods by Dataset Size and Purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are working with open-ended\nresponses from a survey and have data from 30 or fewer\nparticipants, carefully consider whether the data are\nsufficient for meaningful analysis. In many cases, it is appropriate to\nreport that there were too few responses to analyze\nsystematically. However, if you need to report findings, be\ntransparent about limitations. Focus on describing frequently\nmentioned key words, rather than inferring broader themes.\nAvoid suggesting consensus when data are limited, and clearly state that\nfindings reflect input from a small number of\nparticipants. Transparent reporting maintains the credibility\nof your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrouping Voices to Guide Analysis\nBefore you start coding or analyzing, decide:\n\nWhose voices are we centering in this analysis?\nHow will we group participant responses?\n\nYour grouping choices influence:\n\nWhich perspectives are highlighted\nHow themes emerge\nWhat questions you can answer\n\nAt Omni, we might group data by:\n\nParticipant (individual experiences)\nStakeholder Group (e.g., educators vs. public health professionals)\nDiscussion Section (e.g., barriers vs. recommendations)\n\nThese decisions should align with the project’s goals and be clearly documented in reports and presentations.\n\n\nReady for Pre-processing?\nOnce you understand your data, you’re ready to start pre-processing!\n\n\n  \n    Cleaning and Pre-Processing Your Data"

Even with these constraints, small datasets can still provide meaningful insights, especially when there is consistency across participant experiences.\nWhen working with limited data:\n\nFocus on what participants actually shared, rather than attempting to generalize.\nDocument patterns and recurring concerns, while linking them clearly to the project’s research questions.\nBe transparent about the number of participants, the methods used, and any limitations in interpretation.\n\nSmaller samples can still highlight critical issues—such as barriers to access or common recommendations for program improvement—but the scope and representativeness of these findings should be clearly communicated.\n\n\nSuggested Methods by Dataset Size and Purpose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are working with open-ended\nresponses from a survey and have data from 30 or fewer\nparticipants, carefully consider whether the data are\nsufficient for meaningful analysis. In many cases, it is appropriate to\nreport that there were too few responses to analyze\nsystematically. However, if you need to report findings, be\ntransparent about limitations. Focus on describing frequently\nmentioned key words, rather than inferring broader themes.\nAvoid suggesting consensus when data are limited, and clearly state that\nfindings reflect input from a small number of\nparticipants. Transparent reporting maintains the credibility\nof your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrouping Voices to Guide Analysis\nBefore you start coding or analyzing, decide:\n\nWhose voices are we centering in this analysis?\nHow will we group participant responses?\n\nYour grouping choices influence:\n\nWhich perspectives are highlighted\nHow themes emerge\nWhat questions you can answer\n\nAt Omni, we might group data by:\n\nParticipant (individual experiences)\nStakeholder Group (e.g., educators vs. public health professionals)\nDiscussion Section (e.g., barriers vs. recommendations)\n\nThese decisions should align with the project’s goals and be clearly documented in reports and presentations.\n\n\nReady for Pre-processing?\nOnce you understand your data, you’re ready to start pre-processing!\n\n\n  \n    Cleaning and Pre-Processing Your Data"

    "text": "Omni’s Approach to Analysis\nOmni’s qualitative practice is grounded in pragmatism and critical realism.\n\nPragmatism means we focus on providing useful, actionable insights for real-world decision-making. Our goal is to help clients understand participants’ experiences in ways that inform policy, programs, and practice. This reflects a pragmatic stance rooted in the work of scholars like  Morgan (2007)  and  Danermark et al. (2015) , emphasizing inquiry that is guided by consequences and utility.\nCritical realism acknowledges that while participants’ experiences reflect real phenomena (barriers, challenges, successes), they are shaped by context and perspective. Influenced by  Fletcher’s (2017)  work and work by others, this perspective guides us to acknowledge our limitations, reflect on researcher influence, and avoid overstating claims.\nOmni’s qualitative practice draws on reflexive thematic analysis  (Clarke & Braun, 2006)  and content analysis  (Hseih & Shannon, 2005) , emphasizing the researcher’s active role in interpreting data and constructing themes, in alignment with our commitment to critical realism and methodological transparency.\n\n\nTransparent and Systematic Workflows\nAt Omni, we use structured qualitative and mixed-methods workflows. These processes are transparent, systematic, and designed to integrate qualitative and quantitative findings when appropriate.\n\nExample Omni Workflow for Qualitative analysis:\n\nClarify Purpose and Analytic Framework\n\n\nDefine the evaluation questions and purpose of the qualitative analysis\nSelect an analytic method\n\n\nPrepare and Familiarize with the Data\n\n\nClean transcripts/text\nRead through interviews, discussions, or sessions at least once (text like reports you may not need context for, use your discretion)\n\n\nSystematic Coding of the Data\n\n\nDeductive, Inductive, or hybrid\nDeductive coding uses predefined codes (like our dictionaries) to apply to our data\nInductive coding uses text mining or topic modeling to identify emergent themes\n\n\nTheme Development and Refinement\n\n\nAnalyze and refine codes/themes\n\n\nInterpretation and Synthesis\n\n\nCompare themes to evaluation questions and contextual frameworks\n\n\nExplore themes visually\nGet ready for reporting"

    "text": "Tokenization\nTokenization breaks text into individual pieces—usually words, but sometimes phrases or sentences.\n\nMost text mining techniques require tokenized text.\nThis is common for word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling.\nAfter tokenization, we lose the flow of sentences which is generally okay for some analyses, but not for narrative analysis or content analysis.\n\nWhat are Stop Words?\nStop words are common words like “the”, “and”, “but” that don’t add much meaning on their own. Because we want to focus on broader themes from our participants’ voices, we usually want to remove stop words after text is tokenized. This process allows us to focus on content-rich words, like nouns and verbs. We should remove stop words when running a word frequency analysis, topic modeling, or sentiment analysis.\nWe can also create custom stop words that we want to remove from our analyses, for example, location names or project-specific words that appear frequently but aren’t relevant to the analysis.\nExample:\n\nIn the example below, my custom stop words are “travis” and “county”, and they’re added to the stop_words bank which includes other words like “but”, “is”, “the”, etc. If you’d like to see all of the stop words, see View(stop_words).\n\n\n# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Stop words %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n# Use standard stop words + custom ones (e.g., counties, names)\nmy_stop_words &lt;- bind_rows(stop_words, \n                           data.frame(word = c(\"travis\", \n                                               \"county\"), lexicon = \"custom\"))\n\ncleaned_text &lt;- tokenized_text %&gt;% \n  anti_join(my_stop_words, by = \"word\")"

    "text": "Word frequency analysis\nWord frequency analysis is a simple and effective method that counts how often specific words appear in your dataset. It’s often used early in qualitative analysis to get a general sense of prominent topics, but it can also be applied as a stand-alone method to identify frequently mentioned issues in participant responses. Word frequency works best when you have a reasonable amount of text to analyze. As a general best practice, having at least 100–200 content words (excluding stop words) allows for more reliable interpretation of patterns, though smaller datasets can still offer preliminary insights.\nTo ensure accuracy, it’s important to pre-process your text. Using lemmatized words helps avoid counting variations like “run” and “running” separately, and removing stop words—common words such as “the” or “and”—allows you to focus on terms that carry more meaning. In cases where participants mention names of places or projects repeatedly, custom stop word lists can also help refine the results.\nWhile word frequency counts themselves do not explain context or meaning, they can help point to emerging themes by highlighting concepts that recur across participants or within particular sections of discussion. For example, if words like “transportation,” “access,” and “barrier” frequently appear in responses about service challenges, they signal a potential theme that warrants deeper exploration. Word frequency analysis can also help guide more interpretive methods such as thematic or content analysis, and is most useful when findings are contextualized within the broader dataset and research goals.\n\n# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Word frequencies %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n# Word counts\nword_counts &lt;- lemmatized_text %&gt;%\n  count(word, sort = TRUE)\n\nhead(word_counts)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 2\n  word             n\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;int&gt;\n1 time             4\n2 people           3\n3 access           2\n4 application      2\n5 applications     2\n6 process          2\n\n# Visualize the word counts\n\nword_counts %&gt;%\n  top_n(5) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, n), y = n)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 Most Frequent Words\", x = \"Word\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_omni(plot_background_color = \"White\")"

    "text": "Sentiment analysis\nSentiment analysis is a method that measures the emotional tone of text by categorizing words or phrases as positive, negative, or neutral. It can be used to quickly gauge participants’ attitudes toward a topic or to assess the overall tone of responses across interviews, focus groups, or surveys. Sentiment analysis works best when you have larger amounts of text (ideally, datasets with several hundred words or more) because emotional tone can vary within short responses, making sentiment harder to interpret in very small datasets. However, it can still offer insights in smaller datasets when applied carefully and when results are presented as exploratory.\nBest practices for sentiment analysis include pre-processing your text by removing stop words and standardizing language through lemmatization. This ensures consistent scoring and avoids misclassifications due to word variations. Sentiment analysis typically relies on pre-built lexicons (vocabularies), such as Bing, AFINN, or the NRC Emotion Lexicon, which assign emotional values to words. It’s important to note that these lexicons were often designed for general use (such as social media text) and may require customization to fit specific public health or social science contexts. For example, in health-related interviews, a word like “treatment” might appear frequently and carry different sentiment depending on the discussion’s focus.\nWhile sentiment analysis doesn’t capture nuance or context in the way manual coding can, it can highlight patterns of emotional tone across datasets or within specific discussion topics. For example, sentiment analysis might reveal that participants express more negative sentiment when discussing barriers to accessing services, and more positive sentiment when discussing recommendations for future improvements. These insights can help guide deeper qualitative coding or serve as an additional layer of analysis to support findings. As with any automated method, it’s important to review and interpret results in context and to document any limitations or adaptations made to the analysis.\n\nlibrary(tidytext)\n\n# Get sentiment lexicon (if you wanted to test for positive, negative, and 8 emotions, replace \"bing\" with \"nrc\")\nbing &lt;- get_sentiments(\"bing\")\n\n# Join with your text\nsentiment_data &lt;- lemmatized_text %&gt;%\n  inner_join(bing, by = \"word\")\n\n# Count positive vs negative\nsentiment_summary &lt;- sentiment_data %&gt;%\n  count(sentiment)\n\nsentiment_summary\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sentiment     n\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 negative      5\n2 positive      3\n\n# Visualize\nsentiment_summary %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = sentiment, y = n, fill = sentiment)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(title = \"Sentiment Analysis\", x = \"Sentiment\", y = \"Word Count\") +\n  scale_fill_omni_discrete() +\n  theme_omni(plot_background_color = \"White\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is another example of how a sentiment analysis can be vizzed. The figure below is grouped by listening session and the portion of discussion in each listening session. The dark blues represent a more negative sentiment and the tan represents a more positive sentiment. We can see that Community Based Organizations had very positive sentiment when discussing treatment and recovery in their sessions, and negative sentiment about community impact. These polarizing sentiment results may cause us to look further in the CBO transcripts to see what people were positive and negative about in the respective discussions.\n\nTip for finding quotes by tone\nLet’s say you want to pull a quote to include in a report and you know that you want it to be a positively toned quote in a “recommendations” section of your discussion. You can use the sentimentr package to gather sentiments of each sentence (or segment) and sort by sentiment score to find the quote with the most positive tone in your criteria.\nSee an example below:\n\nlibrary(sentimentr)\n\ntext_data_wsentiment &lt;- sentiment(text_data$text)\n\nsentiment_summary &lt;- text_data_wsentiment %&gt;%\n  group_by(element_id) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    avg_sentiment = mean(sentiment, na.rm = TRUE),\n    sd_sentiment = sd(sentiment, na.rm = TRUE),\n    n_sentences = n()\n  )\n\n# Combine summarized sentiment scores with your original data\ntext_data_with_sentiment &lt;- text_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(element_id = row_number()) %&gt;%\n  left_join(sentiment_summary, by = \"element_id\")\n\n# View the combined data\ntext_data_with_sentiment\n\n# A tibble: 7 × 12\n   line speaker     participant_id question section section_label  text  session\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1     2 participant P1                    0       1 Introduction   sure… Educat…\n2     3 participant P2                    0       1 Introduction   i ag… Educat…\n3     5 participant P1                    0       2 Barriers       trav… Educat…\n4     6 participant P2                    0       2 Barriers       also… Public…\n5     8 participant P1                    0       3 Recommendatio… more… Public…\n6     9 participant P2                    0       3 Recommendatio… simp… Public…\n7    10 participant P1                    0       3 Recommendatio… prov… Public…\n# ℹ 4 more variables: element_id &lt;int&gt;, avg_sentiment &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   sd_sentiment &lt;dbl&gt;, n_sentences &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nMixed-methods with sentiment analysis\nBecause sentiment analysis gives you a numeric output as a sentiment score, you can imagine instances where you may want to compare sentiment scores between groups, correlate sentiment scores with other variables in a quantitative survey, or conduct pre-post comparisons."

    "section": "Topic modeling",
    "text": "Topic modeling\nTopic modeling is an automated method used to identify themes or topics across large collections of text. It uses algorithms to group together words that frequently appear in similar contexts, helping reveal hidden patterns or structures in qualitative data. Topic modeling is especially useful when you have large datasets—typically a minimum of 5,000 words or more spread across multiple documents or participant responses. The method works best when documents are of relatively similar length, which helps the model assign topics more evenly.\nThis method is not recommended for use on smaller datasets and would be considered poor practice to rely on it to generate meaningful insights. If you don’t have enough data for this analysis, consider using the content analysis strategy to identify themes in the data.\nBefore running a topic model, it’s important to pre-process your text. Best practices include stemming words to reduce variation (so that “run” and “running” are treated as the same word) and removing stop words to focus on meaningful content. Topic modeling doesn’t require predefined codes or themes, making it a good exploratory tool for surfacing unexpected topics in your data. However, it’s important to remember that these topics are generated algorithmically—they group terms based on statistical patterns, not human interpretation. As a result, human review is always needed to interpret and label the topics in a way that makes sense for your project and participants.\nTopic modeling can complement manual coding by offering a high-level view of common themes, pointing analysts toward areas that may warrant deeper exploration. For example, a topic model might surface clusters of words related to barriers (“transportation,” “access,” “cost”) and another cluster about solutions (“education,” “outreach,” “support”), giving you a starting point for thematic analysis. Commonly used R packages for topic modeling include topicmodels, which provides algorithms like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and tm for pre-processing and managing textual data.\n\nlibrary(tm)\nlibrary(topicmodels)\n\n# Create Document-Term Matrix (DTM)\ndtm &lt;- stemmed_text %&gt;%\n  count(document = 1, word) %&gt;%\n  cast_dtm(document, word, n)\n\n# Fit LDA models with 2 and 3 topics\nlda_model_2 &lt;- LDA(dtm, k = 2, control = list(seed = 1234))\nlda_model_3 &lt;- LDA(dtm, k = 3, control = list(seed = 1234))\n\n# Compare perplexity (lower is better)\nperplexity_2 &lt;- perplexity(lda_model_2)\nperplexity_3 &lt;- perplexity(lda_model_3)\n\n# Print perplexity values to see how many topics we should go with- in this case 2 topics perform better than 3\nperplexity_2\n\n[1] 46.1033\n\nperplexity_3\n\n[1] 46.13593\n\n# View top terms for both models\ntopics_2 &lt;- tidy(lda_model_2, matrix = \"beta\")\ntopics_3 &lt;- tidy(lda_model_3, matrix = \"beta\")\n\n# Top terms for 2-topic model\ntop_terms_2 &lt;- topics_2 %&gt;%\n  group_by(topic) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10, beta) %&gt;%\n  arrange(topic, -beta)\n\n# Top terms for 3-topic model\ntop_terms_3 &lt;- topics_3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(topic) %&gt;%\n  top_n(10, beta) %&gt;%\n  arrange(topic, -beta)\n\n# Display the top terms to compare interpretability\ntop_terms_2\n\n# A tibble: 20 × 3\n# Groups:   topic [2]\n   topic term             beta\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 time           0.0617\n 2     1 transportation 0.0544\n 3     1 services       0.0467\n 4     1 residents      0.0313\n 5     1 challenges     0.0297\n 6     1 agree          0.0281\n 7     1 lot            0.0278\n 8     1 access         0.0276\n 9     1 applications   0.0275\n10     1 application    0.0274\n11     2 people         0.0800\n12     2 time           0.0695\n13     2 process        0.0485\n14     2 application    0.0381\n15     2 applications   0.0381\n16     2 access         0.0380\n17     2 timeconsuming  0.0264\n18     2 campaigns      0.0260\n19     2 buses          0.0254\n20     2 simplifying    0.0253\n\ntop_terms_3\n\n# A tibble: 30 × 3\n# Groups:   topic [3]\n   topic term             beta\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 time           0.0778\n 2     1 transportation 0.0543\n 3     1 services       0.0542\n 4     1 lot            0.0390\n 5     1 residents      0.0353\n 6     1 applications   0.0347\n 7     1 access         0.0312\n 8     1 vouchers       0.0261\n 9     1 makes          0.0256\n10     1 planning       0.0249\n# ℹ 20 more rows"

    "text": "Content analysis\nContent analysis is a method used to count how often predefined concepts, themes, or categories appear in qualitative data. It relies on a dictionary—a list of key terms or phrases—designed to reflect your evaluation questions or coding framework. Content analysis works well for both small and large datasets, making it a flexible tool when you want to systematically measure the presence of specific themes across interviews, focus groups, or open-ended survey responses.\nA key requirement for effective content analysis is a carefully designed dictionary that accurately captures the concepts you’re interested in. This might include terms related to barriers, facilitators, or recommendations, depending on the project’s goals. Best practice is to validate the dictionary by reviewing examples of matched text to make sure the terms are identifying the intended content. You may need to refine the dictionary over time, adding synonyms or removing words that generate false positives.\nContent analysis can help answer questions like “How frequently do participants mention prevention strategies?” or “What percentage of responses reference funding challenges?” It is particularly useful when you need to quantify qualitative data for reporting purposes, or when you want to compare how frequently themes appear across different stakeholder groups. In R, the quanteda package offers efficient tools for dictionary-based content analysis, allowing you to apply a dictionary and quickly summarize how often key terms or concepts appear in the dataset.\n\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 7 documents, 109 features (81.26% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    sure i think one of the biggest challenges is transportation\n  text1    1 1     1   1  5   2       1          1  1              1\n  text2    0 1     0   0  0   0       0          0  0              0\n  text3    0 0     0   0  1   0       0          0  0              0\n  text4    0 0     0   0  0   4       0          0  1              0\n  text5    0 0     0   0  0   0       0          0  0              0\n  text6    0 0     0   0  0   1       0          0  0              0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 1 more document, reached max_nfeat ... 99 more features ]\n\n\nDocument-feature matrix of: 7 documents, 3 features (85.71% sparse) and 0 docvars.\n       features\ndocs    prevention treatment harm_reduction\n  text1          0         1              0\n  text2          0         0              0\n  text3          1         0              0\n  text4          0         0              0\n  text5          2         0              0\n  text6          0         0              0\n[ reached max_ndoc ... 1 more document ]\n\n\n[1] \"text1\" \"text2\" \"text3\" \"text4\" \"text5\" \"text6\"\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 12\n   line speaker     participant_id question section section_label  text  session\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n1     2 participant P1                    0       1 Introduction   sure… Educat…\n2     3 participant P2                    0       1 Introduction   i ag… Educat…\n3     5 participant P1                    0       2 Barriers       trav… Educat…\n4     6 participant P2                    0       2 Barriers       also… Public…\n5     8 participant P1                    0       3 Recommendatio… more… Public…\n6     9 participant P2                    0       3 Recommendatio… simp… Public…\n# ℹ 4 more variables: doc_id &lt;chr&gt;, prevention &lt;dbl&gt;, treatment &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   harm_reduction &lt;dbl&gt;"

    "text": "Thematic Analysis in Dedoose\nIf using Dedoose to conduct thematic analysis, we recommend a structured, reflective approach grounded in reflexive thematic analysis (Clarke & Braun, 2006) and informed by critical realism.\nHere’s how to approach it:\n\nStart by familiarizing yourself with the data by doing a full read through of transcripts or responses before beginning coding. Review notes taken during the interview/focus group during this time.\n\n\nUse memos to reflect on initial impressions, patterns, and researcher assumptions.\n\n\nDetermine whether the analysis should use an inductive or deductive apporach\n\n\nIn an inductive approach, the researcher reads through the data and generates codes as they go. These codes are often grounded in a mix of participant realities and researcher interpretations. Note: If an inductive approach is determined, then the codebook should be generated and iterated upon after the first round of coding (see below).\nIn a deductive approach, the researcher predefines a coding structure and reads through the data applying codes to excerpts. These codes more often heavily rely on the research questions and decisions made by the research team/clients. Note: If a deductive approach is determined, then a codebook should be generated prior to the start of analysis.\nDetermining an inductive versus deductive approach should be communicated with the project lead. The Qual BPT is available to consult on this decision.\n\n\nConduct your first round of coding applying codes broadly, with the intent to synthesize and further detail codes on the second round of coding.\n\n\nThe first round of coding will generally create a lot of new codes (if taking an inductive approach). This is expected and completely normal as codes will be synthesized into broader categories later on.\nAlways use a parent code/child code structure to increase transparency and accuracy in your coding. Parent codes are the broader subject, while child codes are granular topics that make up that topic.\n\nFor example:\n\nProgrammatic Challenges (Parent Code)\nSmall budgets (child code)\nLimited staff (child code)\nFunding cuts (child code)\n\n\nParent codes and child codes should be explicitly referenced in your codebook\nEvery code, both parent code and child code, should have an attached definition so that others who revisit your codes know exactly what that code means\n\n\nConduct your second round of coding applying codes on a more limited basis and collapsing code categories into an organized structure, redefining codes as needed\n\n\nIn your second round of coding it is common to find that some of your initial codes overlap. In cases where the information is contextually the same, you should collapse these codes for clarity and redefine the final code if needed.\n\nFor example, transportation issues + lack of reliable transportation = transportation challenges\n\nAny updates to your codes should be reflected in your codebook\n\n\nConstruct themes thoughtfully after coding, reviewing excerpts by code and grouping them into broader themes that reflect patterns across participants\n\n\nIf you have followed a clear parent code/child code structure, then your themes will likely stem from those. Typically, our research/evaluation questions guide the development of our themes.\n\nFor example,\n\nEvaluation question = What challenges did sub-awardees face over the course of the funding cycle?\nTheme 1: Limited Capacity for Organizational Growth\n\nCode 1: Limited funding\nCode 2: Limited staff\nCode 3: Budget cuts\n\n\n\nDedoose’s Code Co-Occurrence and Code Application tools can assist you in identifying themes that stem from patterns between codes\n\n\nAcknowledge the researcher’s role and reflect on how your perspective, language, and interpretation influenced coding and theme development\n\n\nBe cautious not to overstate findings. Instead, describe patterns and nuances across participant groups, rather than presenting your findings as a consensus across the group.\nRecognize outliers. Some participants may have had a vastly different experience from other participants. Determine whether these experiences should be reported under another theme or in a standalone section.\n\n\nDocument everything and keep a record of how codes and themes evolved\n\n\nOmni’s Qualitative Fundamental Standards foster transparency in the way that we do our qualitative work. Always keep a copy of the raw transcripts (pre-cleaning) to ensure that the raw data is maintained. Additionally, ensure that you are communicating your coding decisions with your team and ask another team member, or a member of the Qual BPT to review your coding, codes, code structures, codebook, and themes.\nClearly state the number of participants or excerpts that informed each theme.\nMake your interpretive lens and limitations explicit - especially when datasets are small or uneven across groups\n\nThematic analysis in Dedoose should still reflect Omni’s commitment to critical realism: treat participant input as reflecting real issues shaped by context and perspective, and be transparent about what the data can—and cannot—support."

Avoid suggesting consensus when data are limited, and clearly state that findings reflect input from a small number of participants Transparent reporting maintains the credibility of your analysis.\n\nGrouping Voices to Guide Analysis\nBefore you start coding or analyzing, decide:\n\nWhose voices are we centering in this analysis?\nHow will we group participant responses?\n\nYour grouping choices influence:\n\nWhich perspectives are highlighted\nHow themes emerge\nWhat questions you can answer\n\nAt Omni, we might group data by:\n\nParticipant (individual experiences)\nVested Partner Group (e.g., educators vs. public health professionals)\nDiscussion Section (e.g., barriers vs. recommendations)\n\nThese decisions should align with the project’s goals and be clearly documented in reports and presentations."

    "text": "Introduction\nAt Omni, we conduct qualitative research in complex, real-world environments. Our clients and projects often require fast timelines, nuanced insights, and transparent methods that can stand up to external review. To meet these needs, we use systematic, reproducible qualitative analysis methods grounded in pragmatism and critical realism.\nThis approach ensures our findings are actionable and reflect the realities and lived experiences of participants, while acknowledging the influence of context, interpretation, and limitations in our data.\n\nPurpose\nThis guide was developed to support Omni staff in conducting methodologically sound, transparent, and reproducible qualitative analyses. It offers practical, step-by-step instructions and highlights best practices for text pre-processing, analysis, and reporting. Whether working with interview transcripts, focus groups, open-ended survey responses, or other text-based data, Omni teams can use this guide to produce findings that are both grounded in participants’ voices and useful for program improvement and decision-making.\n\n\nHow do our qualitative resources align with Omni’s core values?\nInquiry: Provides clear, rigorous methods that encourage thoughtful exploration of participants’ experiences.\nAgility: Equips staff with adaptable tools to meet diverse project needs and respond efficiently to change.\nConnection: Centers participants’ voices and strengthens relationships with the communities and partners we serve.\nAccountability: Uses transparent, reproducible analysis practices to keep our work credible, ethical, and trustworthy.\nIn many applied settings, qualitative methods (and especially mixed-methods) are described in vague terms. Reports may mention “themes emerging” or “triangulating findings,” but rarely explain the actual process used to get there. This vagueness makes it hard to replicate or assess qualitative findings and limits their credibility."

    "text": "Why Are Existing Descriptions of Methods So Vague?\nAt Omni, we aim to avoid vague or ad hoc practices. We document clear, systematic workflows that integrate qualitative insights with quantitative data when appropriate.\nSeveral factors explain the common lack of clarity in methodology:\n\nDifferent disciplines (e.g., public health vs. education research) use different frameworks, leading to inconsistent approaches.\nQuantitative research has standard tools (R, SPSS, Stata), but qualitative tools (NVivo, MAXQDA, Dedoose) often rely on manual processes and don’t always integrate cleanly with quantitative workflows.\nQualitative analysis requires human interpretation and reflexivity. Documenting every step is time-consuming, and under tight timelines, many organizations skip this critical process.\nQualitative and quantitative teams often work separately, without shared standards or mixed-methods integration."

    "text": "Draft Your Analysis Plan\nTwo especially helpful documents to have before qualitative data collection and cleaning begins are:\n\nA codebook (or at least a data dictionary). This helps ensure consistency in how we treat things like speaker names, special terminology, or sensitive content.\nA data analysis plan. This outlines the team’s approach to coding and analysis and helps identify if additional cleaning steps are necessary. For example: anonymizing sensitive details or removing artifacts from automated transcription tools (timestamps, filler words, etc.). This step should happen before data collection begins, but may be slightly adjusted given the quality and count of data received after data collection finishes.\n\nWhenever possible, we expect teams to develop a data analysis plan and request any available data dictionaries or codebooks from the client or partner organizations who collected the data. However, you may need to create a codebook if one doesn’t exist—feel free to reach out to the QualBPT (or whichever team you want to point folks to) if you need support.\nIn many cases, the people drafting the analysis plan are different from those cleaning the qualitative data, so strong cross-team communication is essential. We recommend including the qualitative data cleaner (or cleaning team) in project discussions as early as possible. When drafting the analysis plan, think through what text cleaning steps will be necessary to make the data usable for coding, protect participant confidentiality, and meet the project’s goals."

    "text": "When are my data clean?\nFor there to be project tasks that direct Omni-ites to ‘clean qualitative data,’ and a guide to help in doing so, there should also be a shared understanding of what it means for qualitative data to be clean.\nAt Omni, qualitative data are considered clean when they are organized, de-identified, and ready for analysis or coding.\nThat means the data:\n\nAccurately reflect the original source material (e.g., interviews, focus groups, or open-text survey responses)\nHave been transformed into a structure that makes them easy to navigate and analyze\nProtect the privacy and confidentiality of participants\nAre consistent, clear, and free of irrelevant clutter (like transcription artifacts)\n\n\nWhat Makes a Qualitative Dataset “Analysis-Ready”?\nFor qualitative text data to be ready for analysis, they should meet the following criteria:\n\nSpeaker Information Is Clear and Consistent\n\n\nParticipant speakers and interviewers are clearly labeled in the data.\nEach speaker’s text is grouped logically into segments, preserving conversational flow.\n\n\nParticipant Identifiers Are Specified and Protected\n\n\nReal names, locations, and other direct identifiers have been removed or replaced with participant IDs or pseudonyms.\nConfidential information (e.g., agency names, job titles, organizations) is anonymized where necessary, following Omni’s confidentiality guidelines.\n\n\nQuestions Are Clearly Distinguished From Responses\n\n\nInterviewer questions (or prompts) are labeled or separated from participant responses, as appropriate. This can be done by adding question text as its own field in the dataset or by adding markers in the transcript.\n\n\nText Segments Are Ordered and Organized\n\n\nThe transcript text is ordered according to the flow of conversation. Segments are correctly time-sequenced (even if timestamps themselves are removed).\n\n\nText Is Structured Into a Tidy, Rectangular Format\n\n\nEach row represents a single speaker turn or unit of analysis (e.g., a complete response to a question).\nData are stored in a rectangular table (data frame), with columns for:\n\nSession name or group (e.g., “Educators” or “Public Health”)\nParticipant ID or role (e.g., “Participant 1”, “Facilitator”)\nText segment (the response or comment)\nAny relevant metadata (e.g., discussion section, date)\nTranscription\n\n\n\nArtifacts Are Removed\n\n\nAll timestamps (e.g., [00:05:23], (0:12:45)) are deleted unless specifically required for analysis.\nAutomated transcription quirks (e.g., repeated words, filler words, auto-captions like “[inaudible]”) are reviewed, cleaned, or flagged.\n\n\nText Is Consistent in Style and Format\n\n\nAll text is converted to lowercase, unless case is important for analysis.\nSpelling errors are corrected when they obscure meaning (but regional spellings or participant quirks may be preserved if relevant).\nPunctuation and spacing are standardized (no excessive whitespace, missing periods, etc.).\n\n\nRelevant Identifiers Are Added to the Dataset\n\n\nIf there are multiple sessions or groups, these are labeled (e.g., “Educators,” “Public Health”).\nIf there are themes or discussion sections (e.g., “Challenges,” “Recommendations”), these are identified.\nIf codes are pre-assigned for analytic purposes (e.g., “Pre-implementation,” “Post-implementation”), they are included in the data structure.\n\n\n\nHow Do We Know When Qualitative Data Are Clean\nHere are some guiding questions to help determine when qualitative data are ready for analysis (i.e., clean):\n\nWhat is the plan for coding or analyzing this data?\nThe analysis plan (or coding framework) should inform cleaning decisions. For example, if the team plans to do thematic coding, they’ll need text organized into meaningful speaker turns or responses. What needs to be anonymized?\nIdentify any sensitive information that must be redacted or replaced to maintain confidentiality and ensure participant privacy. Are speaker turns properly attributed and easy to follow?\nEach speaker’s contributions should be clearly labeled, consistently formatted, and grouped logically. Are responses to specific questions clearly identifiable?\nIf interviews or focus groups follow a semi-structured guide, it’s important to separate questions from responses for clarity in analysis. Is the structure of the data appropriate for the analytic tool?\nIf the data are being uploaded to Dedoose, NVivo, or another platform, they should follow the required format (e.g., tidy data frame with speaker IDs and group names). Have all unnecessary artifacts been removed?\nTime stamps, filler words, and transcription errors that don’t add value to the analysis should be removed. Has the cleaned data been reviewed by someone else (QA check)?\nWhenever possible, have another Omni-ite review the cleaned data for accuracy and completeness.\n\n\n\nCommon Issues to Discuss Early in the Cleaning Process\nJust like in quantitative data cleaning, clarifying expectations at the start of a project will save time later. For qualitative projects, consider these:\n\nWill we analyze both facilitator questions and participant responses, or just participant responses?\nHow will we handle overlapping speech, interruptions, or incomplete thoughts?\nDo we need to standardize participant roles (e.g., “Public Health Official” vs. “PH Staff”) for consistency?\nAre we preparing data for manual coding or automated text analysis?\nDo we need to translate or transcribe non-English responses?\nDo we need to connect text segments with broader context, such as the discussion theme or section of the focus group?\n\nQuick summary of “clean qualitative data” at Omni:\n\nAnonymized\nClearly structured and labeled\nOrganized for easy analysis\nFree of unnecessary artifacts\nReady for use in coding and interpretation"

If it is a .vtt file, save it as a .txt or .docx and open the new .txt/.docx file.\nIdentify which sections are present from the session out of the following list of section labels. If there is a slide that is unique to a single session then it will not be included in the list below. For example, the public safety session had a slide about “public safety in the community” that other sessions did not have. In this case, I added a unique section label to mark this section.\n\n\n[Data check]\n[Community impact]\n[Abatement funds]\n[Prevention and harm reduction]\n[Treatment and recovery]\n[Other strategies]\n[Vision for the future]\n[Next steps]\n\n\nAdd the section labels where relevant in the transcript. For example, when you see in the transcript something that marks the beginning of the data checks slide, you would add above that line “[Data check]”. Importantly, note that:\n\n\nYou do not need to add any section labels before the [Data check] label. This will be our first one.\nSection labels should be on their own line and spelled exactly as the labels above, including the brackets []. This is important because our cleaning function searches for brackets!\nPlease do not edit the raw text- you are adding new lines with the section labels, not changing anything in the text.\nNot all sections are in the same order across the sessions (e.g., sometimes treatment and recovery were discussed before prevention and harm reduction) so carefully skim through the transcript to identify the order (this should also align with the order of the deck which is helpful to have open at the same time)\n\n\nSave the file (.docx or .txt) with the section labels included.\nCopy and paste the example chunk below and edit the code to fit your session parameters.\nRun the chunk and check that all sections of the session are shown.\nIf everything looks ok, add your dataframe to the R chunk labeled ```{r bind all data together}.\nRun the whole script below and check the “cleaned_text” dataframe.\n\n\n# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% List interviewer names %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\ninterviewers &lt;- c(\"Shon Reed\", \n                  \"Lindsay Houston\",\n                  \"Hannah Lunkenheimer\",\n                  \"Luke Saunders\",\n                  \"Eden Griffin\",\n                  \"Sam Barron\",\n                  \"Arden Trewartha\")\n\n\n# %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% EXAMPLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n# public safety session\nps_df &lt;- clean_transcripts( # relabel the dataframe something meaningful - like ps_df stands for public safety dataframe\n  file_path = \"../../../data_collection/Listening Sessions/Transcripts/Public Safety Transcript.txt\", # add your transcript file here- you should only need to change out the last part!\n  file_type = \".txt\", # specify whether you have a .txt or .docx file\n  interviewers = interviewers,\n  session_name = \"public safety\" # add a session name\n)\n\nps_df %&gt;% \n  select(section_label) %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\n\n#education 2\nedu2_df &lt;- clean_transcripts( # relabel the dataframe something meaningful - like ps_df stands for public safety dataframe\n  file_path = \"../../../data_collection/Listening Sessions/Transcripts/Education 2 Listening Session file.txt\", # add your transcript file here- you should only need to change out the last part!\n  file_type = \".txt\", # specify whether you have a .txt or .docx file\n  interviewers = interviewers,\n  session_name = \"education\" # add a session name\n)\n\nedu2_df %&gt;% \n  select(section_label) %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\n\n# education\ned_df &lt;- clean_transcripts(\n  file_path      = \"../../../data_collection/Listening Sessions/Transcripts/Education Listening Session Transcript.docx\",\n  file_type      = \".docx\",\n  interviewers   = interviewers,\n  session_name   = \"education\"\n)\n\ned_df %&gt;% \n  select(section_label) %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\n\n#####################\n# 3) Combine all data\n#####################\ncleaned_text &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(\n  # add your new dataframe here to this list\n  ed_df,\n  edu2_df,\n  ps_df)\n\ncleaned_text &lt;- cleaned_text %&gt;%\n  select(-section, -speaker)\n\n\nwrite_rds(cleaned_text, file = \"data_clean/text_data_clean.rds\")"
