## Introduction 

At Omni, we conduct qualitative research in complex, real-world
environments. Our clients and projects often require fast timelines,
nuanced insights, and transparent methods that can stand up to external
review. To meet these needs, we use systematic, reproducible qualitative
analysis methods grounded in **[pragmatism]{.teal-600}** and **[critical realism]{.teal-600}**.

This approach ensures our findings are actionable and reflect the
realities and lived experiences of participants, while acknowledging the
influence of context, interpretation, and limitations in our data.

### Purpose {.unnumbered}

This guide was developed to support Omni staff in conducting
methodologically sound, transparent, and reproducible qualitative
analyses. It offers practical, step-by-step instructions and highlights
best practices for text pre-processing, analysis, and reporting. Whether
working with interview transcripts, focus groups, open-ended survey
responses, or other text-based data, Omni teams can use this guide to
produce findings that are both grounded in participants’ voices and
useful for program improvement and decision-making.

### How do our qualitative resources align with Omni's core values?

**[Inquiry]{.teal-600}**: Provides clear, rigorous methods that encourage thoughtful exploration of participants’ experiences.

**[Agility]{.teal-600}**: Equips staff with adaptable tools to meet diverse project needs and respond efficiently to change.  

**[Connection]{.teal-600}**: Centers participants’ voices and strengthens relationships with the communities and partners we serve.  

**[Accountability]{.teal-600}**: Uses transparent, reproducible analysis practices to keep our work credible, ethical, and trustworthy.  

In many applied settings, qualitative methods (and especially
mixed-methods) are described in vague terms. Reports may mention "themes
emerging" or "triangulating findings," but rarely explain the actual
process used to get there. This vagueness makes it hard to replicate or
assess qualitative findings and limits their credibility.

## Why Are Existing Descriptions of Methods So Vague? {.unnumbered}

**[At Omni, we aim to avoid vague or ad hoc practices. We document clear, systematic workflows that integrate qualitative insights with quantitative data when appropriate.]{.teal-600}**

Several factors explain the common lack of clarity in methodology:

-   Different disciplines (e.g., public health vs. education research)
    use different frameworks, leading to inconsistent approaches.

-   Quantitative research has standard tools (R, SPSS, Stata), but
    qualitative tools (NVivo, MAXQDA, Dedoose) often rely on manual
    processes and don't always integrate cleanly with quantitative
    workflows.

-   Qualitative analysis requires human interpretation and reflexivity.
    Documenting every step is time-consuming, and under tight timelines,
    many organizations skip this critical process.

-   Qualitative and quantitative teams often work separately, without
    shared standards or mixed-methods integration.

## Omni's Approach to Analysis

Omni’s qualitative practice is grounded in **[pragmatism]{.teal-600}** and **[critical realism]{.teal-600}**.

-   **[Pragmatism]{.teal-600}** means we focus on providing useful, actionable insights for real-world decision-making. Our goal is to help clients
    understand participants’ experiences in ways that inform policy,
    programs, and practice. This reflects a pragmatic stance rooted in
    the work of scholars like <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2345678906292462" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Morgan (2007)
    </a>
    and <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781351017831/explaining-society-berth-danermark-mats-ekstr%C3%B6m-jan-ch-karlsson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Danermark et al. (2015)
    </a>, emphasizing inquiry that is guided by consequences and utility.

-   **[Critical realism]{.teal-600}** acknowledges that while participants’ experiences reflect real phenomena (barriers, challenges,
    successes), they are shaped by context and perspective. Influenced
    by <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13645579.2016.1144401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Fletcher’s (2017)
    </a> work and work by others, this perspective guides us to acknowledge
    our limitations, reflect on researcher influence, and avoid
    overstating claims.

-   Omni’s qualitative practice draws on reflexive thematic analysis
  <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1191/1478088706qp063oa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    (Clarke &amp; Braun, 2006)

    (Hseih &amp; Shannon, 2005)
  </a>,
  emphasizing the researcher’s active role in interpreting data and
  constructing themes, in alignment with our commitment to critical
  realism and methodological transparency.

### Transparent and Systematic Workflows {.unnumbered}

At Omni, we use structured qualitative and mixed-methods workflows.
These processes are transparent, systematic, and designed to integrate
qualitative and quantitative findings when appropriate.

![](images/workflow_green.png)

**Example Omni Workflow for Qualitative analysis:**

1.  Clarify Purpose and Analytic Framework

  -  Define the evaluation questions and purpose of the qualitative
    analysis
  -  Select an analytic method

2.  Prepare and Familiarize with the Data

  -  Clean transcripts/text
  -  Read through interviews, discussions, or sessions at least once
    (text like reports you may not need context for, use your
    discretion)

3.  Systematic Coding of the Data

  -  Deductive, Inductive, or hybrid
  -  Deductive coding uses predefined codes (like our dictionaries) to
    apply to our data
  -  Inductive coding uses text mining or topic modeling to identify
    emergent themes

4.  Theme Development and Refinement

  -  Analyze and refine codes/themes

5.  Interpretation and Synthesis

  -  Compare themes to evaluation questions and contextual frameworks

6.  Explore themes visually

7.  Get ready for reporting

## Choosing Your Analysis Tool: R vs. Dedoose vs. AI {.unnumbered}

::: {.panel-tabset}

### R

**[Best when]{.teal-600}**

- Datasets are large or mixed (qual + quant) and need audit trails.  
- You want reproducibility, automation, and version control.  
- You’re under time constraints and have existing scripts/templates (IRR optional or phased).

**[Pros]{.teal-600}**

- Transparent, reproducible code and scalable pipelines.  
- Flexible: word frequency, sentiment, dictionaries, topic models.  
- Produces precise visuals and integrates survey/demographic data easily.

**[Cons]{.teal-600}**

- Steeper setup and learning curve for new R users.  
- Requires clear documentation to ensure shared understanding.

### Dedoose

**[Best when]{.teal-600}**

- Working collaboratively with a team or training new coders.  
- Analyzing small–moderate datasets.  
- Delivering quick turnarounds using built-in IRR workflows.

**[Pros]{.teal-600}**

- Multi-user collaboration, role permissions, IRR features.  
- Low barrier for non-programmers.
- Simple approach for line-by-line coding

**[Cons]{.teal-600}**

- License cost.  
- Limited automation/custom analyses compared to code.  
- Reproducibility and export trails less granular than scripted pipelines.

### AI

**[Best when]{.teal-600}**

- Very fast and low barrier (though not a replacement for traditional qualitative coding.  
- Analyzing small datasets, scoping questions, or drafting a codebook.  
- Preparing stakeholder previews before deeper human analysis.

**[Pros]{.teal-600}**

- Very fast and accessible; supports brainstorming structures.  
- Can summarize, cluster, and compare data quickly.  
- Useful for early iteration before moving to R or Dedoose.

**[Cons]{.teal-600}**

- Not a substitute for human interpretation; may produce hallucinations.
- Inconsistent across runs; lacks deep context if prompts are weak.  
- Data governance and privacy limits — avoid uploading sensitive data.
